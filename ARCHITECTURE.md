This document has two jobs:

1. State **what SHEYTAN actually implements today**, with evidence — so no
   reader (human or AI agent) mistakes a roadmap for a runtime.
2. Record the **validated architectural direction** for SHEYTAN's future AI
   runtime — so future development does not lose the design intent.

# Part I — What is implemented today

Every row below was verified against source code, tests and the stress
suite at release `v1.1.4Z` (see `worklog.md` for the audit method).
"TESTED" means covered by `go test` packages and/or the 30-scenario
stress suite; see the exact commands in `agent.md` §10.

| Subsystem | Package(s) | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Managed llama.cpp engine lifecycle (download → launch → health → supervise → bounded auto-restart → scheduled updates) | `internal/llm`, `internal/updater` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | 3 restarts/episode with 1/2/4 s backoff; downloads context-bounded (10 min) and size-capped (2 GiB) |
| LLM client: streaming, retries, stall watchdog, sampling wire format | `internal/llm` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | no overall stream timeout by design; 5-min zero-byte stall watchdog pinned by `TestStreamStallWatchdogAbortsQuietStream` |
| Agent loop (plan → tool calls → observations → verify → answer) | `internal/agent` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | **sequential** tool execution; iteration cap (default 25) + per-run time budget (default 60 min) |
| Tool registry (17 tools when all features enabled) | `internal/tools`, `internal/lab`, `internal/research`, `internal/memory`, `internal/sandbox` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | `shell`, `files`, `codeExec`, `webSearch`, `git`, `browser`, `dataAnalysis`, `json`, `archive`, `fetch`, `diff`, `screenshot`, `linux`, `coding_lab`, `research`, `memory` + sandbox override |
| Coding Lab (isolated workspace, lexical command policy, verification gates, bounded repair loop, snapshot-before-promote) | `internal/lab` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | policy is lexical + env-pinned, not a kernel sandbox (documented limitation) |
| Code-exec sandbox governor (Windows Job Objects) | `internal/sandbox` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | memory/CPU configurable, fail-closed default ON |
| Attachments (content-addressed streaming staging, caps, normalization, bounded retrieval with provenance headers and measured stats) | `internal/attachments` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | sha256 staging streamed while hashed (RAM ≈ 16 KiB head + 128 KiB buffer, not the file size), symlink-safe; retrieval reads each object ≤1× per call with a 32 MiB retention cap and byte-range fallback (v1.1.5Z Phase 3) |
| Chunking (shared provenance chunk engine: paragraph-boundary splitting with full metadata, byte budgets, head+tail windowing, history windowing) | `internal/chunking` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | `ChunkText` (processing version v2): deterministic IDs, byte ranges, token estimates, total counts, optional overlap, UTF-8-safe splits; **not** structural/semantic repository chunking — see Part II §4 |
| Context plan (explicit budget: system / tools / recall / attachments / history sections with priorities and pressure) | `internal/contextplan` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | the seed of the future budget taxonomy — see Part II §5 |
| Context cache (content-keyed LRU, TTL, bounds, single-flight coalescing, oversized-entry guard, measured counters) | `internal/contextcache` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | processing version v4; concurrent same-key computes are coalesced; a value above the per-entry bound is rejected, never retained |
| Memory (M1–M7 trust classes, persistent JSONL store, append-aware parsed cache, copy-free search) | `internal/memory` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | external material quarantined; appends/deletes fold into the cache incrementally (no full re-parse per write) without changing any trust rule |
| Recall (BM25 over past turns, cached corpus statistics, recency boost, 👍/👎 feedback steering) | `internal/recall` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | per-capsule terms + distinct counts cached; per-query scoring allocation-free; feedback wired via `/api/feedback` since v1.1.4Z |
| Continuum chapter rollover | `internal/continuum` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED (wired post-run) | deterministic `Distill` runs in production; the LLM `Enhance` pass is implemented and unit-tested but has **no production caller** (deliberate future option) |
| Research (auto/GitHub/Reddit/DuckDuckGo/SearXNG, TTL cache, provenance) | `internal/research` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | SSRF/alias contracts tested |
| Vision (mmproj projector pairing, image classification, screenshot capture) | `internal/vision`, `internal/screen` | PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED | pairing logic implemented + unit-tested; not yet exercised with a real projector model (known limitation) |
| Multi-agent pipeline (planner → executor → critic → summarizer) | `internal/multiagent` | PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED | wired via CLI `ask --multi` only; **not** exposed through the HTTP API or UI; runs **sequentially** on one model |
| Config source (copy-on-write live configuration) | `internal/config` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | race-detector-clean; `Source` is the only sanctioned mutation path |
| Observability (logs, rotation, crash reports, diagnostics zip with redaction, perf HUD) | `internal/logging`, `internal/resources` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | |
| Sessions (persistence, concurrency, sidecars) | `internal/sessions` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | |
| Release engineering (single-source version sync, CI gates, zip-slip-safe updater) | `scripts/release-version.mjs`, `.github/workflows/build-desktop.yml`, `internal/updater` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | `package.json` is the single source of truth for the version |
| Frontend (React 19 + TS + Vite, embedded via `go:embed`) | `src/`, `web/static` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | `npm run build` must be re-run after frontend changes |
| **LLM backend contract** (v1.1.5Z Phase 1): engine-agnostic interface — Start/Stop/Health/LoadModel/UnloadModel/Generate/StreamGenerate/Cancel/ModelInfo/HardwareInfo/Metrics — plus generation-backend selection with automatic llama.cpp fallback | `internal/llm` (`backend.go`, `llamabackend.go`) | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | `LlamaBackend` delegates to the existing LlamaServer+Client paths (no behavior change); since Phase 5 selection resolves to the NATIVE backend when it is selected and actually generation-capable (see the Phase 5 row below) |
| **SHEYTAN Native Engine foundation** (v1.1.5Z Phase 1): supervised `shtn-engine-host` subprocess (spawn → protocol/ABI handshake → health → ready → bounded auto-restart), length-prefixed JSON IPC, platform-neutral hardware profile (native probe + sysinfo merge), native metrics (measured values only), C++ engine with a narrow C ABI (create/destroy/health/hwinfo/metrics) and its own test suite | `internal/native/engine`, `native/engine/` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | Superseded by Phase 5: the same subprocess now serves REAL native generation (see below); supervision/protocol/bounds unchanged |
| **Native GGUF model loading** (v1.1.5Z Phase 2): bounds-checked, overflow-safe C++ GGUF reader (magic/version/metadata/tensor-table validation, hostile-input bounds, mmap-backed lazy access), `LoadModel`/`UnloadModel` with replace semantics and clean resource release, real metadata extraction (architecture, parameter count, context, vocab, embedding, layers, quantization, tensor count, file size), load-time memory plan, model states `unloaded/loading/loaded/failed` with host-restart resets, wire ops and the `llm.ModelInfo` mapping with additive fields; Phase 5 adds the llama-graph VALIDATION verdict (`generationCapable` + inspectable reason) at load time | `internal/native/engine` (`model.go`, `protocol.go`, `backend.go`), `native/engine/src/{gguf,model,llama}.*`, `native/engine/include/shtn/*` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | Loading alone still does not serve generation — but since Phase 5 a VALIDATED llama model DOES: `GenerationCapable()` is true for alive + validated models and generation routes natively (see the Phase 5 row) |
| **Native engine foundation primitives** (v1.1.5Z Phase 4): real GGUF-backed tokenizer (BPE/Unigram/WPM with merges, special tokens, BOS/EOS/UNK, bounded encode/decode — materialized by re-walking the mmap on demand), real KV-cache, real bounded scheduler, real sampling primitives (greedy/temperature/top-k/top-p/repetition penalty/seedable RNG), streaming UI coalescing (rAF-boundary batching — one setState per frame regardless of token rate), frame-budget perf HUD | `internal/native/engine` (`tokenizer.go`), `native/engine/src/{tokenizer,kv_cache,scheduler,sampler}.*`, `src/store.ts` (coalescer), `src/perf-hud.ts`, `src/main.tsx` | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED | Superseded/completed by Phase 5: the KV cache now holds real fp16 data populated by the forward pass; the scheduler runs a real worker thread; the sampler consumes real logits. UI coalescing contract unchanged. Phase 5 measured the HUD claims honestly (no guaranteed-FPS claims) |
| **REAL native transformer inference + generation** (v1.1.5Z Phase 5): llama-architecture forward pass in portable C++ (embeddings → per-layer RMSNorm → Q/K/V matvec → RoPE NORM → causal GQA attention over the fp16 KV cache → output projection + residual → RMSNorm → SwiGLU FFN + residual → final norm → logits; double accumulators; scratch reuse; norm weights dequantized once), tensor access layer with row dequant for F32/F16/Q4_0/Q4_1/Q5_0/Q5_1/Q8_0 (anything else fails explicitly), generation runner (engine-tokenized prompt, context-bound REJECT policy, per-request KV reset, prefill + decode loop with per-token cancellation observation, sampler over real logits, EOS/max/context/cancel stops with EOS never emitted into text, UTF-8-complete chunk emission, monotonic-clock metrics), REAL scheduler worker (single slot, real active/completed/cancelled/failed counts), host generation lanes with streamed event frames + real cancel (protocol/ABI v4), Go ipcConn streaming (event channel per request, backpressure, cooperative-cancel abandon path), Backend Generate/StreamGenerate over llm.StreamEvent/PerfStats, generation router wired through the orchestrator (native when selected+capable+plain-text; llama.cpp otherwise; pre-first-token fallback logged), numerical correctness pinned against an independent Python reference (staged values + final logits within tolerance), e2e acceptance through the real Go↔C++ boundary | `native/engine/src/{tensor,llama,forward,generate}.*`, `native/engine/src/{kv_cache,scheduler,engine}.*` (upgraded), `native/engine/tests/{test_tensor,test_forward,test_generate}.cpp` + `tests/reference/make_fixture.py`, `internal/native/engine/{generation,backend,runtime,protocol}.*` (upgraded), `internal/runtime/runtime.go` (router), `internal/agent/orchestrator.go` (seam) | IMPLEMENTED + TESTED (12 C++ suites + Go fake-host suite + 5 real-host e2e tests + router tests, all green) | Support is NARROW and honest: llama architecture only; F32/F16/Q4_0/Q4_1/Q5_0/Q5_1/Q8_0 tensors only; rope.freq_scale 1.0 only; plain role-labeled prompt (no chat-template interpretation); tools/images stay on llama.cpp; measured SLOWER than llama.cpp on the fixtures (pp 56810 vs 17695 tok/s, tg 28643 vs 20708 tok/s on the tiny fixture — see worklog Phase 5 table; no native-speed claim made) |

Explicit non-goals of the **current** runtime (do not mistake these for
missing features):

- The agent loop executes tools **sequentially**. Parallel tool execution
  is a deliberate non-goal today.
- The HTTP/WS API is loopback-only with no auth token; the OS user account
  is the trust boundary.
- The Lab command policy is lexical (denylists + env pinning), not a
  kernel-level sandbox.

## I.9 — The SHEYTAN Native AI Engine architecture (v1.1.5Z, IMPLEMENTED foundation + model loading)

The target engine stack is now wired at the foundation level:

```text
React/TypeScript
      ↓
    Wails
      ↓
   Go Core
      ↓
SHEYTAN Native API        ← llm.Backend contract (Go) + IPC protocol
      ↓
C++ Native Engine         ← native/engine/ (narrow C ABI + host process)
```

Go remains the main application/runtime engine. The C++ native engine is
the future heavy-compute/AI execution engine. **Phase 1 implemented the
architecture foundation and Phase 2 added native GGUF model loading —
still no inference.** The managed llama.cpp engine remains the only
generation engine (fallback and default).

### Go↔C++ boundary decision: supervised subprocess + IPC (IMPLEMENTED)

Two candidate boundaries were evaluated:

| Criterion | A) cgo / shared library | B) supervised subprocess + IPC (**chosen**) |
|---|---|---|
| Crash isolation | a native crash kills the whole Go process | the host dies; Go's bounded watchdog restarts it (verified by tests) |
| Windows-first cross-build | requires a Windows C++ toolchain per build host; breaks today's `CGO_ENABLED=0` cross-compile | plain binary spawn; cross-build preserved |
| Future Android | JNI/binder coupling | maps to an Android service process; protocol unchanged |
| Maintainability | build-coupled; errors cross ABI silently | explicit protocol with version handshake; both sides tested |
| Performance | in-process calls | coarse-grained ops only — lifecycle, health, hardware, metrics, whole generation requests; **never** tiny high-frequency calls, so IPC overhead is irrelevant at this granularity |

The boundary is: `shtn-engine-host`, a C++ subprocess speaking 4-byte
little-endian length-prefixed JSON frames over stdin/stdout (1 MiB frame
cap, protocol + ABI version handshake that fails closed on mismatch,
malformed requests answered with bounded errors — never a crash). The
underlying engine core is a narrow C ABI (`include/shtn/engine.h`):
create/destroy/health/hardware_info/metrics since Phase 1,
load_model/unload_model/model_info/memory_plan since Phase 2,
tokenizer_init/tokenizer_info/tokenizer_encode/tokenizer_decode/
kv_cache_info/scheduler_info since Phase 4, and
generate/cancel/generation_stats since Phase 5 (protocol v4 / ABI v4;
every bump lands on both sides together, mismatches fail closed; the
generate op streams event frames with the request id before its final
frame — one lane per request, bounded, so the dispatch loop stays
responsive mid-generation).

### Native model lifecycle (Phase 2, IMPLEMENTED)

`LoadModel` on the native backend drives a strict, all-or-nothing native
load: validate the path (regular file) → open + `fstat` + whole-file
read-only `mmap` (lazy — tensor data is faulted in page by page, never
copied) → parse the GGUF container (magic, version 2/3, bounded counts
and lengths, per-KV type validation) → parse the tensor table (dims
bounds, overflow-checked element products, per-tensor offsets validated
against the data section, exact byte-size checks for known GGML types)
→ extract metadata only from keys actually present → compute the memory
plan (weights = tensor-data span; KV = 2·K/V·layers·context·embedding·2
bytes f16; workspace = context·vocab·4 logits row; fixed 64 MiB runtime
allowance; totals overflow-checked; compared against detected RAM) →
state `loaded`. Any failure unmaps, releases everything, and walks the
model state to `failed` with the reason — a failed load never leaves a
stale model behind. `UnloadModel` is idempotent; `LoadModel` while
loaded replaces the resident model. The Go side resets its model
snapshot on every host lifecycle boundary (a fresh host maps nothing).

### Model state vocabulary (Phase 2)

The model concern uses its own small vocabulary — `unloaded`,
`loading`, `loaded`, `failed` — deliberately separate from the engine
states (`llm.State*`) that keep describing the host subprocess. There is
still only ONE engine-state system and now ONE model-state system; the
two never mix.

### State authority

The native engine's state lives in `internal/native/engine` using the
**same state vocabulary and event shape** (`llm.State*`, `llm.EngineEvent`)
as the llama.cpp engine. There is no second, conflicting engine-state
system: each engine owns its authoritative state, the API layer reads one
snapshot per engine, and native transitions reach the same WS activity
pipeline with "Native engine …" captions. Generation on the native path
cycles ready → busy → ready (the existing vocabulary — no
"inferencing"/"generating" states were invented in Phase 5).

### Honest capability reporting

Since Phase 5, `engine.Backend.GenerationCapable()` returns `true` ONLY
when the engine is alive AND the loaded model's llama graph validated at
load time (every required tensor present with the right shape and a
supported type) — the same boolean `llm.SelectGenerationBackend` reads to
route generation (native when additionally selected and the request is
plain text; llama.cpp otherwise, with tools/images and pre-first-token
native failures falling back with a logged reason). A host restart or
model unload flips it back to false — capability tracks reality. The
Phase 1-4 rules still hold underneath: generation metrics (TTFT,
prompt/decode speed) are reported only from MEASURED values (the C++
engine's monotonic clock since Phase 5), and native `ModelInfo` reports
only values the C++ reader actually read or derived; absent GGUF keys
stay zero. An unsupported model reports `generationCapable=false` with an
inspectable reason (architecture, missing tensor, unsupported type) —
never a silent llama.cpp switch without evidence.

## II.1 — Small, fast, local models are the foundation

SHEYTAN should be designed so a user with modest hardware can run a
capable multi-agent system. The architecture must not assume one giant
model.

Preferred philosophy:

```text
many efficient agents
+ orchestration
+ tools
+ external memory
+ objective verification
```

rather than:

```text
one enormous model
```

Rationale:

- **Lower memory requirements.** Several small quantized models can share
  a machine that could not hold one very large model.
- **Higher concurrency.** Small models iterate quickly, so multiple agents
  can work in parallel within the same compute envelope.
- **Faster agent iteration.** Shorter time-per-token means planner/critic
  style loops stay interactive instead of minutes-per-pass.
- **Practical low-end hardware support.** This is the audience SHEYTAN is
  for: local-first, privacy-first, no datacenter GPU required.
- **Model specialization.** Different agents can use different models —
  a coding-tuned model for the coder role, a cheap fast model for routing
  and classification, a multimodal model only when vision is needed.
- **Better parallel workloads.** N small models × M concurrent agents
  scales on consumer hardware; one large model serializes everything.
- **Reserve strength for exceptional tasks.** A larger or multimodal
  model can be invoked selectively when a task genuinely requires it,
  instead of paying its cost on every turn.

The key architectural claim: **model size is not the sole source of
system intelligence.** Structure (tools, memory, retrieval, verification,
orchestration) contributes at least as much as raw model capacity.
SHEYTAN's intelligence should come from the *system*, not from a single
overwhelming model.

Current state (honest): the runtime loads **one** model per session
(`model` config key) and every run uses that model. There is no
small-models-first composition, no per-agent model assignment, and no
model pool today.

## II.2 — Model tiers and hardware-adaptive routing (PLANNED)

Intended ladder, expressed generically. Tiers describe *capability and
resource cost*, not specific products; the runtime should discover what
is available locally and map models to tiers by measured properties
(parameter count, context length, modality, quantization, tokens/sec).

| Tier | Conceptual class | Intended role |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 0 | smallest local model | ultra-low-resource tasks: routing, classification, extraction, formatting |
| Tier 1 | small local model | default agent turns, cheap tool loops, summarization |
| Tier 2 | medium local model | complex reasoning, planning, code editing |
| Tier 3 | larger local model | difficult local tasks: multi-file refactors, deep debugging |
| Tier 4 | optional high-end (possibly multimodal) model | exceptional reasoning, visual workloads, specialized tasks |

Routing factors the future orchestrator should weigh:

```text
task complexity
modality (text / image / structured)
latency requirement
available hardware (RAM, VRAM, tokens/sec)
context requirement
confidence / retry state
resource budget (battery, thermal, concurrent runs)
```

The architectural principle is **model-agnostic, capability-based
routing**: the system must not hard-depend on any specific model brand or
version. Model names change every few months; the tier abstraction and
routing rules are the durable part.

**Candidate model examples** (examples only — **none of these are
integrated with SHEYTAN**; specs verified against public sources in
2026-09 and will change):

- **Gemma-class** (Google open models): the E2B/E4B "edge" size class
  runs in roughly 2–4 GB of memory and suits Tier 0/1; the 12B–27B class
  suits Tier 2/3; the line offers up to 128K (edge) / 256K (large)
  context windows and multimodal variants, which is interesting for a
  Tier 4 vision agent.
- **GLM-class** (Z.ai open weights): the "Air" class couples a large
  total parameter count with a small *active* parameter count
  (MoE), giving high capability per active FLOP — a candidate for
  Tier 3/4 when hardware allows; recent generations offer 128K–200K
  context windows and strong agentic/tool-use behavior.

These families are named **only as concrete illustrations of the tier
ladder**. SHEYTAN must not make any of them mandatory, and any future
default model choice must be re-verified against authoritative specs at
the time of integration. Small instruct-tuned models from other families
can fill Tier 0–2 equally well.

Current state (honest): there is no tier system, no router, and no
automatic model selection. The user picks one model in the UI.

## II.3 — The Context Engine: external context and chunking (PLANNED)

SHEYTAN's future context architecture must not depend on repeatedly
placing an entire repository or a huge Markdown document into the model
context window. The intended pipeline:

```text
Repository
   ↓
Structural index
   ↓
Semantic index
   ↓
Hierarchical retrieval
   ↓
Context builder
   ↓
Small local model
   ↓
Action
   ↓
Verification
   ↓
Memory update
```

The core mental model:

- **Model context = working memory.** Small, expensive, rebuilt per turn,
  holds only what the current reasoning step needs.
- **External structured storage = project memory.** Large, cheap,
  persistent, queryable, versioned.

The system should be designed around:

- **structural chunking** — chunks derived from document/source structure
  (headings, symbols, blocks), not fixed-size token windows
- **semantic chunking** — chunk boundaries respecting meaning, with
  embedding-assisted grouping where available
- **hierarchical retrieval** — drill down from repo → file → section →
  chunk only as needed
- **metadata-aware retrieval** — filter/rank chunks by path, type, mtime,
  symbol, heading
- **provenance** — every retrieved fragment carries file path + span, so
  edits can be located and audited
- **neighboring context** — retrieval returns parents/siblings, because a
  chunk in isolation is often misleading
- **cross-reference retrieval** — follow links, imports, includes and
  definitions on demand
- **persistent memory** — distilled facts/decisions outlive individual
  sessions (today's `memory`/`recall`/`continuum` are the seed)
- **context budgeting** — a hard allowance per section (Part II §5)
- **artifact-based agent communication** — agents exchange compact
  structured artifacts instead of transcript dumps (Part II §7)

Current state (honest): SHEYTAN has the *seeds* — an explicit context
plan with measured prompt bytes (`internal/contextplan`), a content-keyed
single-flight cache (`internal/contextcache`), a provenance chunk engine
(`internal/chunking`, deterministic metadata + byte ranges since
v1.1.5Z Phase 3), streaming attachment staging with bounded retrieval
(`internal/attachments`), an append-aware trust-classed memory store,
BM25 recall and continuum rollover. Measured Phase 3 results (same
inputs, 2-vCPU container, median of 5): chunk derivation 1.6× faster
with 4.4× fewer bytes allocated, memory search 2.3× faster, recall
search 2.0× faster with 122× fewer allocations. There is **no**
repository structural or semantic index, no embeddings, no hierarchical
retrieval, and no context builder that composes retrieved chunks for a
model. "Context Engine" is the name for the future system that unifies
these.

## II.4 — Hierarchical chunk model (PLANNED)

Intended hierarchy:

```text
Repository
  ↓
File
  ↓
Section / Symbol
  ↓
Chunk
  ↓
Exact edit region
```

For Markdown specifically, the chunker should understand: headings and
nested headings, lists, tables, code blocks, links and references, and
definitions — so that a "section" is a real structural section, not an
approximate byte window. For source code, the equivalent is symbols
(functions, types, methods) and their spans.

A chunk should conceptually retain metadata such as:

```text
file path
section path (e.g.  "README.md > Architecture > Context Engine")
chunk ID
parent section ID
previous chunk ID / next chunk ID
token estimate
content hash (for cache keys and change detection)
provenance (how the chunk was produced / last verified)
```

This must never be reduced to naive fixed-token splitting: fixed windows
cut semantic units in half, destroy provenance, and make retrieval
matching noisy.

Current state (honest): `internal/chunking` splits text at paragraph
boundaries under byte budgets, windows long content head+tail, and gives
attachment chunks a stable identity. Chunks carry **no** structural
metadata (no section path, no parent/sibling links, no content hash
index). The hierarchy above is the target Context Engine data model.

## II.5 — Context budgeting (PLANNED extension of an implemented seed)

The future agent should treat context as an explicitly budgeted resource
allocated among:

```text
system instructions
task description
memory (persistent facts, distilled frameworks)
retrieved source (chunks + provenance)
tool output
conversation history
reasoning scratch space
response allowance
```

The goal is not "use as much context as possible" but
**"use the smallest sufficient working set."** Smaller working sets mean
faster inference, more concurrency, less drift, and deterministic
overflow behavior on low-resource machines.

Current state (honest): `internal/contextplan` already implements a real
budget — `numCtx` minus an output reserve, sections for system / tools /
recall / attachments / history with priorities, exact measurement of tool
schemas before windowing, and a visible error on overflow. This is the
implemented seed. The future work is: finer-grained sections (task,
retrieved source, tool output, reasoning), budget policies per agent
role, and budget-aware retrieval (fetch fewer/smaller chunks when the
budget is tight). Extend the existing package; do not invent a parallel
mechanism.

## II.6 — Multi-agent architecture (PLANNED)

Intended shape: a set of specialized, low-cost agents coordinated by an
orchestrator. Example conceptual roles:

```text
planner          decomposes the task
coder            produces edits
researcher       gathers external/internal context
tester           writes and runs checks
debugger         diagnoses failures
documentation    updates docs to match code
reviewer         audits diffs
verifier         runs objective verification gates
```

Agents should not all use the same model. The orchestrator should
eventually assign models per agent according to:

```text
task complexity
modality
latency requirement
hardware
context requirement
confidence in prior attempts
resource budget
failure / retry state
```

Current state (honest):

- The **primary runtime is a single-agent sequential loop**
  (`internal/agent`): one model, tools executed one at a time, iteration
  cap + time budget. Parallel execution is a **deliberate non-goal
  today**.
- A **sequential** planner → executor → critic → summarizer pipeline
  exists (`internal/multiagent`) and is reachable from the CLI
  (`sheytan ask --multi`). It uses a single model and is not exposed via
  the HTTP API or the UI.

Do not claim true parallel multi-agent execution, per-agent model
assignment, or a persistent agent society. Those are Part II futures.
The truth is: sequential single-model pipelines today; specialized,
model-diverse, eventually-parallel agents as the target.

## II.7 — Agent-to-agent communication via structured artifacts (PLANNED)

Future agents should communicate primarily through **structured
artifacts** — files with schemas — rather than by forwarding entire
conversation histories:

```text
Agent A
  ↓ writes
analysis.json   patch.diff   findings.md   test-results.json
  ↓ read + verified by
Agent B
  ↓
verification result
```

Why:

- **Reproducibility** — artifacts are inspectable inputs/outputs; a run
  can be replayed and diffed.
- **Auditability** — the artifact chain is the evidence trail.
- **Token efficiency** — a consumer reads the distilled artifact, not the
  producer's whole transcript.
- **Long-running workflows** — artifacts persist across restarts; agents
  resume from files, not from live RAM.
- **Low-resource operation** — small models can consume compact,
  well-shaped artifacts far more reliably than huge raw histories.

Current state (honest): there is no production artifact protocol between
agents. The closest existing primitives are the Lab's patch export, the
`diff` tool, and JSONL sidecars (sessions, recall, memory). A future
implementation should define the artifact schemas first and treat every
artifact as untrusted input (validate before consume), consistent with
the security invariants in `agent.md` §7.

## II.8 — Document editing architecture (PLANNED)

Markdown and documentation editing are core SHEYTAN workloads. The
intended future workflow:

```text
request
 ↓
intent analysis
 ↓
document search / index
 ↓
relevant section retrieval
 ↓
dependency / cross-reference retrieval
 ↓
context construction (budgeted)
 ↓
model edit proposal
 ↓
structured patch
 ↓
diff inspection
 ↓
Markdown / document validation
 ↓
tests / semantic checks
 ↓
final verification
```

The model is **never the authority** on whether the document was
correctly modified. The repository/tooling must validate:

- syntax (well-formed Markdown / target format)
- structure (heading tree intact, no accidental section deletion)
- references (internal links resolve where testable)
- required sections still present
- forbidden deletions (protected content untouched)
- duplicate headings where they matter
- malformed tables
- unbalanced code fences
- expected architecture statements (when the doc is contract-bearing)
- version metadata consistency (release surfaces)
- generated assets in sync (e.g. `web/static` after frontend changes)

Current state (honest): the primitives exist — `files` tool (read/write
with jail), `diff` tool, Lab verification gates, `release-version.mjs`
for release-surface metadata, and CI checks for embedded frontend and
release identity. There is **no** section-aware retrieval, no structured
document patch format, and no Markdown-structure validator today.

# Part III — Documentation truth standard

Every significant capability statement in this repository must fit one
of these categories:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `IMPLEMENTED` | wired end-to-end in production code paths |
| `TESTED` | covered by automated tests (unit / HTTP-level / stress) |
| `PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED` | exists but not wired to every surface (e.g. CLI-only, no UI) |
| `EXPERIMENTAL` | behind a flag / unstable path, may change |
| `PLANNED` | agreed direction, **not** built — must say so explicitly |
| `OPTIONAL FUTURE` | idea kept on record, no commitment |

Rules:

1. Never let a planned capability read as an implemented one. Bad:
   "SHEYTAN runs hierarchical multi-agent memory." Good: "The current
   runtime provides measured context budgets and BM25 recall. The planned
   Context Engine (Part II §3) is intended to add hierarchical retrieval."
2. Resolve contradictions with **source code as the authority**, not by
   copying a claim into more documents.
3. When implementation status changes, update Part I of this file, the
   relevant section of `README.md` / `agent.md`, and add a dated entry in
   `worklog.md` — in the same change.
4. Model names and versions are examples, never foundations. Verify specs
   against authoritative sources at integration time, and label them as
   candidates otherwise.
