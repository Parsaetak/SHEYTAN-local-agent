```

Branch: `main`

Current release:

```text
v1.1.5Z
```

v1.1.5Z is the **SHEYTAN Native AI Engine** release line. Phase 1
established the backend abstraction, the supervised native engine path
and the C++ engine skeleton. Phase 2 added **native GGUF model
loading**: a hardened C++ GGUF reader, memory-mapped model access, real
metadata extraction, load-time memory planning, the model lifecycle and
the `ModelInfo` surface through Go. Phase 3 rebuilt the **local data
pipeline for memory efficiency**: a shared chunk engine with full
provenance metadata, single-flight content caching, streaming attachment
staging, append-aware memory-store caching and allocation-free recall
scoring — all measured with before/after benchmarks. Phase 4 added the
**native engine foundation primitives**: a real GGUF-backed tokenizer
(BPE/Unigram/WPM), a real KV-cache data structure sized from model dims
(GQA-aware, bounded), a real bounded scheduler, real sampling
primitives, and a frame-budget-aware streaming UI with a diagnostic
perf HUD. Phase 5 (this log, first below) implemented the **REAL native
transformer inference path**: the llama-architecture forward pass
(RMSNorm / RoPE / GQA causal attention over a true fp16 KV cache /
SwiGLU / logits), the sampler consuming REAL logits, REAL token-by-token
generation with coarse-grained streamed chunks over the IPC protocol,
REAL cooperative cancellation, measured generation metrics, the
load-time llama-graph capability verdict, and the backend selection
router wired through the orchestrator (native when selected AND capable
AND plain-text; llama.cpp otherwise with a logged, inspectable reason).
Native generation support is deliberately narrow and honest: llama
architecture only, F32/F16/Q4_0/Q4_1/Q5_0/Q5_1/Q8_0 tensor types only,
and the current forward pass is portable scalar C++ measured SLOWER
than llama.cpp (the numbers are below — no native-speed claim is
made). llama.cpp remains fully functional as the fallback (and the
default generation engine for everything the native path does not
support). Full phase logs below.

# v1.1.5Z Phase 5 Repair Log (2026-09-11, post-phase5 CI failure)

## Root failure (GitHub Actions run 34546418321)

`Source & frontend audit → Verify repository shape and release identity`
failed with `[sheytan-release] ERROR: unable to read build/config.yml:
ENOENT`. Root cause: the v1.1.5Z-phase5 commit (eedb766) DELETED
`build/config.yml` (52 lines removed) although the phase 5 replacement
manifest itself declares "deleted: none in Phase 5" and lists the file
as committed Wails source. The deletion was accidental, not intentional.

## Additional accidental deletions discovered in the same commit

The same commit also deleted four INTERNAL PACKAGES that the surviving
code still imports — the tree at eedb766 did not compile at all (CI
never reached a Go step to expose it):

- `internal/sessions`  (imported by runtime, api, recall, continuum, cmd)
- `internal/sandbox`   (imported by runtime, cmd/stress)
- `internal/attachments` (imported by runtime, api)
- `internal/memory`    (imported by runtime, multiagent, cmd)

All four were restored byte-identical from the Phase 4 baseline
(84324b8) — exactly what the phase 5 manifest's "unchanged" status
promised. After restoration the tree builds and all packages test green
again.

## Real defects found and fixed during continued validation

1. **Misleading engine state when the native backend serves**: the
   `/api/engine` top-level `state` (the single UI badge source) always
   reported the llama.cpp state machine, so a user with
   `engineBackend: native` whose llama.cpp fallback could not start
   (offline / no binary) saw "failed" while native generation actually
   worked. Fix: when the effective serving backend is native (same
   selection policy that routes generation), state/detail/pid/
   loadedPath/logs come from the native engine. Purely local reads; the
   llama path is byte-unchanged.
2. **Run gate required llama.cpp even when native serves**:
   `EnsureLLM`/`EnsureLLMContext` always gated runs on
   `Llama.Start()`, so native-only deployments could never execute a
   run. Fix: the same native-serving early exit (selected + actually
   generation-capable). The fallback gate still applies whenever native
   is not serving.
3. **CI never executed the Go↔C++ integration tests**: the C++ engine
   was built only in the audit job (no Go steps); build-linux/build-windows
   re-checkout fresh trees without `native/engine/build`, so every
   `TestRealCppHost*` test SKIPPED in all Go jobs. Fix: build-linux now
   builds + ctests the C++ engine before `go test`, so the real-host
   e2e suites actually run in CI.
4. **Flaky unload-guard test** (`native/engine/tests/test_generate.cpp`,
   "model unload during active generation → rejected"): the sequencer
   thread polls `active_requests > 0` then asserts unload is rejected
   — but the generation used temperature 1.1 sampling, with which the
   toy model can emit EOS within the first few tokens, completing the
   generation before the sequencer's unload lands (observed ~2/8 runs
   failing under load, zero engine defect behind it — the test's own
   "deterministic order — no race" comment was wrong). Fixed by
   switching the sub-test to greedy decode, which on this fixture
   deterministically runs to max_tokens (verified: finish reason
   "length", 200/200 tokens). Post-fix: 10/10 ctest runs green.
5. **Stale Phase-1/Phase-4 documentation contradicting the live
   implementation** (the §25 audit): README claimed native inference
   "NOT implemented — every generation request therefore runs on
   llama.cpp" and "NO forward pass yet"; config.go / engine.go /
   runtime.go carried Phase-1 "generation is NOT implemented yet"
   comments. All updated to the verified Phase 5 truth (implemented +
   narrow + honest limits).

## Runtime verification performed (this repair)

- `node scripts/release-version.mjs --check` — all four surfaces
  consistent at 1.1.5-zeta (build/config.yml restored).
- `go build -tags headless ./...` PASS; `go vet -tags headless ./...` PASS.
- `go test -tags headless ./internal/... -count=1` — 27 packages PASS
  (including the restored sessions/attachments/memory and the
  releasegate critical-package gate).
- `go test -race -tags headless` on agent/llm/api/native-engine — PASS.
- C++: cmake configure + build + `ctest` — 12/12 suites PASS
  (engine, protocol, host, gguf, model, tokenizer, kv_cache,
  scheduler, sampler, tensor, forward, generate).
- Real-host Go integration tests re-run WITH the built host present:
  10/10 `TestRealCppHost*` PASS (lifecycle, model, tokenizer, KV,
  scheduler, phase5 generation/cancel/context-overflow/unsupported/
  backend contract).
- Stress suite: 30 pass / 0 fail.
- Frontend: npm ci, typecheck, lint (0 warnings), build, sync into
  web/static; `web/static/index.html` contains the root div and
  `diff -r dist web/static` is empty.
- **Real application smoke test (headless build, real C++ host, real
  GGUF fixture)**: launch → native engine ready (honest state after the
  fix) → model visible with real GGUF metadata → native load with
  capability verdict → prompt submitted → REAL native generation
  streamed over the WebSocket (3 coalesced response frames; perf
  activity reports measured 493.7 tok/s, 1.2 s TTFT) → assistant
  message persisted → abort mid-run ("Aborted by user", engine
  recovered to ready) → next request succeeds → SIGTERM shutdown clean
  (host subprocess reaped). The context-overflow REJECT policy was also
  exercised for real (over-long prompt → explicit engine-side rejection
  → logged fallback attempt).

## Environment-verified vs unverified (honest list)

- Verified here (Linux, Go 1.26.0, Node 24, CMake 4.4.3, g++ 14): all
  of the above.
- NOT verifiable in this environment: the Wails/GTK GUI desktop build
  (no GTK4/WebKitGTK-6.0 dev libraries, no root) — the Windows CI job's
  CGO-free cross-compile remains the verification path, unchanged.
- Windows runtime execution: unverified here (Linux-only environment);
  CI covers build + console probe + package integrity.

# v1.1.5Z Phase 5 Implementation Log (2026-09-11)

## What was implemented (REAL native transformer inference + generation)

1. **KV cache correction first** (the Phase 4 defect): the cache was a
   `unique_ptr<float[]>` while documenting/reporting fp16 — the actual
   allocation was 2x the reported `capacity_bytes`, and per-layer
   pointer math used `sizeof(float)` against f16-byte counts so
   adjacent layers overlapped. Rewritten as TRUE `uint16_t` fp16-bit
   storage (software round-to-nearest-even conversion in `fp16.h`,
   bit-exact vs numpy across 65k random values + boundary cases):
   `capacity_bytes` IS the allocation size, layer offsets are
   element-exact, `used_bytes` equals positions × per-position
   K+V footprint, `reset()` clears counters only (no memset),
   allocation bounds-checked (context cap 1M, total 16 GiB, RAM check).
   Regression tests pin expected == allocation == reported.
2. **Tensor access layer** (`src/tensor.*`): lookup, type/shape/
   byte-range validation, row dequantization for EXACTLY
   F32/F16/Q4_0/Q4_1/Q5_0/Q5_1/Q8_0 (per-row block padding per the GGML
   nbytes formula; block tail discarded). Everything else fails with an
   explicit unsupported error — never a reinterpretation.
3. **Llama graph derivation + validation** (`src/llama.*`): hyper
   parameters from real GGUF metadata — required keys must exist (both
   historical rms_eps spellings accepted; disagreement fails closed as
   ambiguous; rope.freq_base required, no default invented);
   head_dim from attention.key_length or the documented emb/heads
   derivation; GQA divisibility checked; the full tensor set
   (token_embd, output [tied or untied], output_norm, per-layer
   attn_norm/ffn_norm/attn_q/k/v/output/ffn_gate/up/down) validated for
   presence/shape/type at LOAD time → `generationCapable` + reason in
   model_info (metadata-level; nothing allocated).
4. **Transformer forward pass** (`src/forward.*`): the actual llama
   computation — embeddings → per-layer [RMSNorm → Q/K/V matvec →
   RoPE (NORM pairing, freq base from metadata) → causal GQA attention
   reading the fp16 KV cache → output projection + residual → RMSNorm
   → SwiGLU FFN + residual] → final norm → logits. Double
   accumulators; scratch reused (no per-token heap allocations); norm
   weights dequantized once per model binding; per-token (not
   per-layer) KV position advance.
5. **Generation runner** (`src/generate.*`): prompt encoded by the
   engine's own GGUF tokenizer (BOS-primed, llama-style ▁ handling);
   context bound is a REJECT policy (prompt + max_tokens > context →
   explicit error, no silent truncation); per-request KV reset (no
   state leaks between requests); prefill (cancellation observed every
   16 tokens) + decode loop (cancellation observed EVERY token);
   sampler consumes the REAL logits (temperature/top-k/top-p/
   repetition-penalty/seed — Phase 4 primitives); stop conditions: EOS
   (sampled EOS is never emitted into the text), max_tokens, context
   exhaustion, cancellation, error; UTF-8-complete chunk emission
   (first token immediate for honest TTFT, then ≥8-token/24-byte
   windows — never one IPC frame per token); metrics from the
   monotonic clock only (prompt/decode/TTFT/tok/s/KV positions; zero
   = not measured).
6. **Scheduler worker thread** (`src/scheduler.*`): single slot (max
   concurrent 1), FIFO queue with cap, real active/completed/cancelled/
   failed counters; queued cancels remove, active cancels set the
   cooperative flag; graceful shutdown cancels + joins. Without a
   worker the Phase 4 semantics are preserved (tests unchanged).
7. **Engine ABI v4** (`engine.cpp`): `shtn_engine_generate` (blocking
   submit to the scheduler; work registry by request id; the emit
   callback fires per streamed chunk), `shtn_engine_cancel_generation`,
   `shtn_engine_generation_stats`; unload/load rejected while a
   generation holds the mapping (SHTN_ERR_MODEL_STATE); metrics report
   the real scheduler active count; new error codes -9 CANCELLED,
   -10 CONTEXT_OVERFLOW, -11 GENERATION.
8. **Host generation lanes** (`host_main.cpp`): the `generate` op
   spawns a bounded lane (≤16; the engine's queue bounds acceptance
   anyway) that calls the ABI and writes event frames
   (`{"id":N,"ok":true,"event":"chunk","result":{requestId,text,token,
   final}}`) followed by one final frame (finish reason + measured
   metrics, or a bounded error frame). All frame writes share one mutex
   so event frames never interleave mid-frame with dispatch responses.
   `cancel` is real. EOF/shutdown cancels in-flight lanes and joins
   them BEFORE exit (no writes to dead streams). The dispatch loop
   stays fully responsive during generation.
9. **Go streaming IPC** (`internal/native/engine`): protocol v4;
   `ipcConn.streamCall` — event channel per pending request (never
   closed; late stragglers absorb into the bounded buffer), consumer
   goroutine forwarding to the callback with backpressure, a
   deliver-then-drain abort protocol, and a final-frame guarantee
   (every buffered event is delivered before the call returns).
   `Engine.StreamGeneration` (busy-state cycling in the existing
   vocabulary, 5-minute zero-progress stall watchdog mirroring the
   llama stream contract, ContextExhaustedError mapping).
10. **Backend + routing** (`backend.go`, `internal/runtime`, `internal/
    agent`): `Generate`/`StreamGenerate` real (llm.StreamEvent with
    finish reason + measured usage; PerfStats from measured metrics);
    `GenerationCapable` = alive + loaded + validated; tools/images
    requests return `llm.ErrNotImplemented` (the explicit fallback
    signal); the orchestrator gained a `GenerationStream` seam wired to
    `Stack.streamGeneration` — native when selected + capable +
    plain-text, llama.cpp otherwise, pre-first-token native failures
    fall back with the reason logged; pre-warm loads the selected model
    natively and logs the capability verdict.
11. **Fixtures + independent reference** (`tests/reference/
    make_fixture.py`): deterministic tiny llama GGUFs (F32; llama.cpp-
    loadable — verified with llama-bench; both rms_eps key spellings
    now the canonical one) + a numpy reference implementation computing
    the staged values and final logits WITHOUT the C++ code, including
    the exact fp16 K/V round-trip semantics.
12. **Prompt format note (honest limitation)**: the native path renders
    messages with a plain role-labeled format ("System:/User:/Assistant:")
    — it does NOT interpret the model's chat template. llama.cpp keeps
    full template fidelity; the router only sends plain-text requests
    natively.

## Runtime verification performed (Phase 5)

- ctest: 12/12 suites green — engine, protocol, host (streaming
  generate + cancel through real OS pipes), gguf, model, tokenizer,
  kv_cache (byte-accounting regressions), scheduler, sampler, tensor
  (hand-computed dequant values), forward (independent Python
  reference: staged values within 1e-5, logits within 1e-3, greedy
  argmax matches), generate (greedy determinism, seed reproducibility,
  EOS/max-tokens/context/cancel, metrics sanity, KV reset between
  requests, non-llama fallback, unload guard, engine reusability after
  every failure).
- Go: 23 packages `go test -tags headless` green; `-race` green on
  agent/llm/api/native-engine/runtime; `go vet` clean.
- Real Go↔C++ boundary: 5 e2e tests (generation + streamed chunks +
  measured metrics + KV/scheduler accounting; mid-decode cancellation;
  context-overflow rejection + reuse; unsupported-model fallback
  signal; backend contract incl. llm.StreamEvent/PerfStats).
- Frontend gates: typecheck, lint, build green (frontend untouched —
  the Phase 4 coalescing contract is intact by construction).
- Stress gate 30/0; release-version check consistent (NO version bump —
  §34 discipline: the release workflow decides version changes).

## Measured performance (same fixtures, single thread, no claims beyond these numbers)

| fixture | engine | prompt (pp5) | decode (tg) |
|---|---|---|---|
| tiny-llama-f32 (85KB) | llama.cpp (llama-bench @df03399) | 56810 tok/s | 28643 tok/s |
| tiny-llama-f32 | NATIVE (this phase) | 17695 tok/s | 20708 tok/s |
| tiny-llama-slow (5.7MB) | llama.cpp | 5888 tok/s | 2656 tok/s |
| tiny-llama-slow | NATIVE | 285 tok/s | 611 tok/s |

Native model load: 301–437µs (fixtures); TTFT 0.3ms (tiny) / 17.6ms
(slow); KV accounting measured exactly (8192B cap / 4352B used / 34
positions on the tiny fixture). Host RSS: idle 2044KB, +144KB after
load+generate (tiny fixture).

**Honest conclusion: the native engine is SLOWER than llama.cpp on
these fixtures** (pp ~3.2x, tg ~1.4x on the tiny; pp ~20x, tg ~4.3x on
the slow). Expected — llama.cpp has heavily optimized kernels (SIMD,
fused quantized compute, layout-aware access) while Phase 5 is portable
scalar dequant-then-dot C++ with correctness as the priority. The
numerical correctness is pinned by the Python reference; optimization
is future work (agent.md §13 task 1).

## Known limitations (Phase 5, read literally)

- Native generation: llama architecture ONLY; F32/F16/Q4_0/Q4_1/Q5_0/
  Q5_1/Q8_0 tensors ONLY; rope.freq_scale 1.0 ONLY; plain prompt
  format (no chat-template interpretation); tools/images stay on
  llama.cpp.
- Native forward pass is scalar C++ — slower than llama.cpp (numbers
  above); performance optimization is future work.
- shtn-engine-host is not shipped/auto-downloaded yet (build from
  native/engine; packaging is agent.md §13 task 3).
- Windows: the numerical engine is platform-neutral C++ (no
  platform-specific inference code added); Windows RUNTIME execution
  was not exercised in this environment (Linux-only here; Windows CI
  cross-build remains the verification path).
- The Wails/GTK desktop build still cannot compile in this environment
  (no GTK4/WebKit dev libs); Windows CI job builds it.
- Vision (mmproj) path not exercised with a real projector model.
- Small instruct models may not emit formal tool calls; loop mechanics
  covered by deterministic tests.
- The API is loopback-only without an auth token — the OS user account
  is the trust boundary.
- The Lab command policy is lexical (denylists + env pinning), not a
  kernel sandbox.
- Agent tool calls execute sequentially by design.

# v1.1.5Z Phase 4 Implementation Log (2026-09-10)

## Goal

Phase 4 turns the native engine from "GGUF loader + metadata + memory plan"
into a real foundation for native inference: a working tokenizer, a real
KV-cache data structure, a bounded scheduler, real sampling primitives, and
a smooth frame-budget-aware application UI. The transformer forward pass
remains a later phase — Phase 4 implements the foundation primitives that
the future inference loop will call, NOT the forward pass itself.

```text
Phase 2:   GGUF loader + metadata + memory plan
Phase 4:   + REAL tokenizer (BPE/Unigram/WPM)
           + REAL KV cache (sized from model dims, GQA-aware, bounded)
           + REAL bounded scheduler (single-slot, cancel, drain)
           + REAL sampling primitives (greedy/temperature/top-k/top-p/
             repetition penalty, seedable RNG)
           + streaming UI coalescing (rAF-boundary batched updates)
           + frame-budget diagnostic HUD
Phase 5+:  transformer forward pass → real native inference (NOT YET)
```

## What was implemented (REAL — verified by tests)

### C++ native engine (new files)

- `native/engine/src/tokenizer.h` + `tokenizer.cpp` — real GGUF tokenizer:
  reads `tokenizer.ggml.tokens` / `token_type` / `scores` / `merges` arrays
  by re-walking the memory-mapped file (the first-pass parser skips array
  element bytes for hostile-input safety; this materializes them on demand
  only when the host asks). Supports BPE (Llama-style with U+2581 space
  marker, and gpt2-style), Unigram (greedy longest-match — a faithful
  simplification of SentencePiece Viterbi, documented as such, NOT claimed
  as a full lattice), and WPM (BERT-style WordPiece with `##` continuation
  marker). Special token resolution (BOS/EOS/UNK/PAD/SEP/EOT) from GGUF
  scalars. Encode is deterministic, bounded by `max_tokens`; decode is
  bounded by `max_bytes`. Unknown tokenizer model kinds return
  `SHTN_ERR_UNSUPPORTED` honestly — the host surfaces that and the
  llama.cpp fallback remains the generation backend.
- `native/engine/src/kv_cache.h` + `kv_cache.cpp` — real KV-cache data
  structure sized from real model dimensions (layer_count, embedding_length,
  head_count, head_dim, kv_head_count for GQA, context_length). One
  contiguous allocation holding per-layer K then per-layer V; layer-major,
  position-contiguous. Capacity bytes is the REAL allocation:
  `2 (K+V) * layers * ctx * kv_dim * 2 (f16 bytes)`. Used bytes is
  proportional to `used_positions` — but `used_positions` is honestly 0
  until a forward pass exists (no fabricated utilization). Bounded by
  `kMaxContextLength` (1M positions), `kMaxKVBytes` (16 GiB) and the
  available-RAM check (the host passes its measured free RAM; the cache
  refuses an allocation that would not fit). Move-only, RAII, idempotent
  release. `reset()` marks positions unused without zeroing buffers (the
  future forward pass will overwrite them; zeroing would waste work).
- `native/engine/src/scheduler.h` + `scheduler.cpp` — real bounded
  scheduler. Single-slot execution (`kMaxConcurrent = 1`) — no speculative
  continuous batching (the execution path cannot support it correctly yet).
  Bounded queue (default 8, hard cap 64). FIFO ordering. Real cancellation
  (queued requests removed and marked cancelled; the future active-request
  cancel hook is wired but no worker thread runs in Phase 4). Graceful
  shutdown drains the queue with "shutting down" cancellations. Counts are
  measured (queued, totals since create); `active` is honestly 0 in Phase
  4. No busy polling (waits on a `condition_variable`).
- `native/engine/src/sampler.h` + `sampler.cpp` — real sampling primitives.
  Greedy (argmax) for `temperature == 0`. Temperature scaling. Top-k
  filtering (`nth_element` partial sort, O(n) average). Top-p (nucleus)
  filtering with cumulative softmax walk. Repetition penalty (CTRL
  formulation: `if logit > 0: divide; else: multiply`). Seedable
  deterministic RNG (xorshift64* with SplitMix64 seed scrambling — not
  `std::mt19937` to keep the binary lean and the sequence reproducible).
  Deterministic: same `(logits, recent_tokens, config, rng)` → same token.
  NULL/empty logits return `SHTN_ERR_INVALID_ARG` (never crash).

### C++ ABI / protocol extension (additive — v2 → v3)

- `include/shtn/engine.h` — Phase 4 surface declarations: `shtn_engine_tokenizer_init`,
  `shtn_engine_tokenizer_info`, `shtn_engine_tokenizer_encode`,
  `shtn_engine_tokenizer_decode`, `shtn_engine_kv_cache_info`,
  `shtn_engine_scheduler_info`.
- `include/shtn/types.h` — Phase 4 ABI structs: `shtn_tokenizer_info`,
  `shtn_kv_cache_info`, `shtn_scheduler_info`, `shtn_encode_options`,
  `shtn_encode_result`, `shtn_decode_options`, `shtn_decode_result`.
- `include/shtn/version.h` — `SHTN_ABI_VERSION` and `SHTN_PROTOCOL_VERSION`
  bumped 2 → 3 (additive — a v2-era host can still build against this
  header by ignoring the new functions; the wire protocol adds new ops but
  does not change existing op shapes).
- `src/engine.cpp` — owns a `shtn::kv::Cache` and a `shtn::sched::Scheduler`
  per engine instance; implements the new ABI functions; the KV cache is
  NOT auto-allocated on model load (it reports the honest zero-state until
  a future op explicitly allocates it).
- `src/host_main.cpp` — dispatches the new ops (`tokenizer_init`,
  `tokenizer_info`, `tokenizer_encode`, `tokenizer_decode`,
  `kv_cache_info`, `scheduler_info`); every op round-trips one frame in,
  one frame out (coarse-grained — no per-token IPC chatter).
- `src/json.h` + `json.cpp` — added `extract_encode_payload` and
  `extract_decode_payload` helpers (mirroring `extract_load_payload`'s
  bounds-checked scanner pattern).

### Go side (new + updated files)

- `internal/native/engine/protocol.go` — `ProtocolVersion` bumped 2 → 3;
  added op constants (`OpTokenizerInit`, `OpTokenizerInfo`,
  `OpTokenizerEncode`, `OpTokenizerDecode`, `OpKVCacheInfo`,
  `OpSchedulerInfo`) and `ValidOps` entries.
- `internal/native/engine/backend.go` — `ABIVersionExpected` bumped 2 → 3.
- `internal/native/engine/tokenizer.go` (NEW) — Go-side surface:
  `Engine.InitTokenizer`, `Engine.TokenizerInfo`, `Engine.TokenizerEncode`,
  `Engine.TokenizerDecode`, `Engine.KVCacheInfo`, `Engine.SchedulerInfo`.
  Honest error reporting: `ErrUnsupportedTokenizer` for an unsupported
  tokenizer model kind; `Generate`/`StreamGenerate` STILL return
  `llm.ErrNotImplemented` (Phase 4 does NOT fake inference).
- `internal/native/engine/phase4_integration_test.go` (NEW) — end-to-end
  tests against the real C++ host: `TestRealCppHostPhase4Tokenizer` (loads
  a real BPE GGUF, inits the tokenizer, encodes "hello" with BOS+EOS →
  [1, 6, 7, 2], decodes [6, 7] → " hello"), `TestRealCppHostPhase4KVCache`
  (verifies the honest zero-state), `TestRealCppHostPhase4Scheduler`
  (verifies real measured counts, single-slot).

### Frontend (new + updated files)

- `src/store.ts` — added a streaming coalescer: `queueStreamingContent` /
  `queueStreamingReasoning` accumulate token chunks; `flushStreaming` runs
  on a `requestAnimationFrame` boundary and writes ONE `setState` per
  frame. `handleConversationEvent` now uses the coalescer instead of
  calling `setState` per token. Lifecycle events (done/error/session)
  bypass the coalescer (`flushStreaming()` runs first, then resets
  `streaming`). `createSession` / `selectSession` / `disconnectActivity`
  call `resetPendingStreaming()` to drop pending chunks for the old
  session. The coalescer is the Phase 4 §17 contract:
  `native token stream → Go stream → WS events → UI accumulation buffer
  → frame-aligned render/update`.
- `src/perf-hud.ts` (NEW) — frame-budget diagnostic HUD. OFF by default;
  toggle with Ctrl+Shift+P or `window.__shtnTogglePerfHUD()`. Auto-detects
  the display refresh rate (sample 10 rAF intervals, derive Hz, compute
  the target budget: 8.33 ms for 120 Hz, 16.67 ms for 60 Hz). Measures
  real frame time (avg/min/max), dropped frames (> 1.5× budget),
  longtask count (PerformanceObserver), coalesced stream-update frequency
  (counts `flushStreaming` calls per second, NOT per token). The HUD
  reports `optimized for high-refresh displays / frame-budget aware /
  120 Hz-capable presentation where hardware permits` — it does NOT claim
  guaranteed 120 FPS.
- `src/main.tsx` — initializes the perf HUD and wires the stream-update
  recorder.

## Validation performed (this phase)

## Honest scope statement

Phase 4 implements REAL foundation primitives. It does NOT implement:

- the transformer forward pass (no RMSNorm, no GQA attention, no RoPE,
  no SwiGLU MLP, no logits projection);
- native generation (Generate/StreamGenerate still return
  `llm.ErrNotImplemented`);
- real measured TTFT / tokens-per-second (the GenerationStats struct
  carries the shape, but every value is honestly 0 — no fabricated
  inference metrics);
- Windows/Linux verification on real hardware (the build is cross-compile-
  clean; CI runs the Windows job; this sandbox is Linux-only and the
  Windows-specific behavior is verified by the existing `main_windows.go`
  + `sysinfo` CIM path that was already shipped in v1.1.4Z and unchanged
  here);
- continuous batching / speculative decoding (the scheduler is single-slot
  by design — the execution path cannot support either correctly yet);
- a real GPU/NPU forward pass (the hardware profile can REPRESENT
  accelerators; no kernel exists).

The llama.cpp fallback remains the production generation backend. Native
generation will be enabled ONLY after a real transformer forward pass
exists and is verified end-to-end against a real GGUF model — never
before.

# v1.1.5Z Phase 3 Implementation Log (2026-09-10)

## Goal

Make SHEYTAN significantly more efficient for real local workloads by
improving the complete data path — file/attachment/conversation →
loading → normalization → chunking → cache → context planning →
recall/memory → LLM request — without breaking verified behaviour,
wire contracts or any security bound. Generation stays on llama.cpp;
the Phase 2 native GGUF loading path is untouched and still passes its
real-host integration tests.

## Baseline verification (before any change)

The Phase 2 tree was verified FIRST at commit `dc4172c`
(v1.1.5Z-phase2): `go build -tags headless ./...`, `go vet -tags headless
./...`, the full `go test -tags headless ./internal/... -count=1` suite
(all packages PASS), race tests on agent/llm/api/native-engine (PASS),
npm typecheck/lint/build (PASS), stress 30/30, release-version --check
PASS, CMake configure+build, ctest 5/5 and the two real-host Go↔C++
integration tests PASS. Only then did Phase 3 work begin.

## Audit findings (measured, from source)

1. `attachments.Retrieve → chunkText`: the ENTIRE stored object was
   re-read per selected chunk (N selected chunks = N full-object reads
   and N full-size transient allocations per retrieval).
2. `attachments.Add`: the whole upload (up to 64 MiB) was buffered in
   RAM just to hash and classify it, including binaries and images —
   only a 16 KiB head is needed for classification.
3. `memory.Store`: every append invalidated the parsed-cache key, so the
   next search re-parsed the WHOLE JSONL file; search additionally
   copied every entry per call.
4. `recall.Engine.Search`: rebuilt a term-frequency map for EVERY
   capsule on EVERY query (≈15k map allocations per turn at the 5000
   capsule index cap).
5. `contextcache`: concurrent callers of the same expensive key both
   computed; a single entry larger than the byte bound could pin the
   cache above its bound forever (eviction always keeps ≥1 entry).
6. `attachments.buildChunks`: recomputed chunk offsets by re-scanning
   the text with `strings.Index` per chunk; hard splits could cut a
   multi-byte UTF-8 rune in half.
7. `llm.ReadModelCard`: unbuffered reads issued one syscall per skipped
   tokenizer-array string; the model-card cache key ignored file size.
8. Context construction had no measured instrumentation (bytes,
   chunks considered/selected, cache behaviour, pressure).

## 1. Unified loading pipeline

Ownership is now explicit and single-copy per stage:

```text
Source/Input        staged upload, object file, session JSON, memory JSONL
→ Loader            attachments.Manager.spool (streaming), readObject/
                    readObjectRange (counted), memory/recall scanners
→ Normalizer        attachments.NormalizeText (zero-copy fast path)
→ Chunker           chunking.ChunkText (single interval pass)
→ Cache             contextcache.Cache (single-flight, bounded)
→ Retriever         attachments.RetrieveWithStats, recall.Engine.Search
→ Context Builder   contextplan.Assemble + orchestrator (measured plan)
```

No duplicate loaders were introduced; the legacy `writeObjectAtomic` /
`buildChunks` paths were removed after their last callers moved to the
shared flow.

## 2. Chunking engine (internal/chunking/chunker.go)

New `ChunkText` / `ChunkerConfig` / `Chunk` (v2 processing version):

- one interval pass, no rescanning; chunk strings share the source
  backing array (no repeated copying, no O(n²));
- exact byte offsets recorded during the pass (the old path re-scanned);
- configurable `Overlap` (rune-aligned, progress-guaranteed) and
  `MaxChunks` without unbounded memory;
- UTF-8-correct hard splits (a hard cut backs up to a rune boundary);
- deterministic chunk IDs from source content hash + processing
  parameters + chunk content hash;
- full metadata per chunk: source identity, byte range, estimated
  tokens, sequence index, total chunks, processing version, preview;
- raw source data is never retained by derived chunks.

`SplitParagraphs` was re-expressed on the same pass; with ASCII input
its cuts are byte-identical to the pre-Phase-3 algorithm (a fuzz-style
equivalence test pins this). Lossless reconstruction is preserved for
Overlap=0. `attachments.buildChunks` now maps `chunking.Chunk` onto the
unchanged wire format (`<attID>:<index>:<hash8>`, same JSON fields), so
stored meta files stay valid.

## 3. Cache as a data-layer primitive (internal/contextcache)

- `GetOrCompute[T]`: single-flight coalescing — the first caller
  computes OUTSIDE the cache mutex, joiners share the result; panics
  are propagated to joiners and never wedge the in-flight slot;
- oversized-entry guard (`WithMaxEntryBytes`): `Put` (now returns
  bool) rejects a single entry above the per-entry bound instead of
  letting it pin the cache above its byte bound;
- exact accounting: `inserts` counted on new keys only, oversized
  rejections and coalesced joins measured;
- `Stats` gained `inserts`, `coalesced`, `oversizedRejected`; content
  keys, version invalidation, config fingerprints, LRU and both bounds
  are unchanged. Processing version bumped 3 → 4.

## 4. Attachment loading (internal/attachments)

- STREAMING STAGING: `Add` spools to a temp object while hashing
  (SHA-256 on the fly) and keeps only a 16 KiB sniff head plus one
  pooled 128 KiB copy buffer in RAM — binaries and images are never
  fully buffered anymore; oversize/empty rejects happen during the
  copy and never touch the object store;
- content addressing, symlink refusal, dedupe, naming, caps and
  provenance unchanged (same error strings, same IDs);
- text processing reads the stored object back once;
- `RetrieveWithStats`: each attachment's object is read AT MOST ONCE
  per retrieval call and reused for every selected chunk (verified:
  objectReads == 1 for a multi-chunk call); objects larger than the
  32 MiB per-call retention cap degrade to exact byte-range reads —
  correctness identical, memory bounded;
- `NormalizeText` zero-copy fast path: valid UTF-8 without CR/BOM
  returns the original bytes (previously up to three full-content
  copies);
- measured resource counters on the Manager (`ResourceUsage()`):
  files staged, staged bytes, object reads, bytes read, chunks built,
  cache sheds.

## 5. Context construction + instrumentation

- `contextplan.Plan.PromptBytes`: the MEASURED byte size of the final
  prompt (set by the orchestrator after assembly; never an estimate);
- the orchestrator logs one context-metrics line per turn (prompt
  bytes, estimated tokens, pressure, elided, recalled, attachments);
- the API server logs one attachment-retrieval line per turn with the
  measured retrieval stats (attachments considered, chunks
  considered/selected, bytes, object reads, cache hit);
- wire/UI contracts unchanged — the plan JSON gained additive fields
  only.

## 6. Persistent memory efficiency (internal/memory)

- APPEND-AWARE cache: `AppendEntry` folds the normalized entry into the
  parsed cache and refreshes the stat key; `DeleteByID` rewrites from
  the warm cache (it previously re-parsed the file on every delete);
  `Clear` caches the empty state; an empty store parse warms the cache;
- copy-free search: `SearchWithOptions` scores the cached entries
  read-only (scores in a parallel slice; cached entries never mutated)
  and copies only matches — the whole-store copy per search is gone;
- a non-existent file correctly stays cold (nothing to cache);
- trust rules untouched: M1–M7, quarantine, external downgrade,
  authoritative-user-fact logic and search semantics are byte-for-byte
  the same paths as before, re-verified by the full trust test suite;
- measured counters: `Store.ParseStats()` (full parses vs incremental
  appends) — tests assert appends cause ZERO full re-parses.

## 7. Resource policy

Bounds are unchanged in law and now observable in practice: staging
caps (size/count/total/timeout), the 512-chunk-per-file cap, the
32 MiB per-call retrieval retention cap with graceful degradation to
byte-range reads, the cache bounds (entries, bytes, per-entry), the
5000-capsule recall cap, and the memory-store stat-keyed cache. The
degradation ladder is: shed retained derived objects → re-read from
disk on demand → never truncate authoritative data (nothing
authoritative is retained in the shedded structures). All counters are
real measurements exposed via `attachments.ResourceUsage()`,
`contextcache.Stats` and `memory.ParseStats()`.

## 8. Other loading paths

- `llm.ReadModelCard` now reads through a 64 KiB buffered window —
  skipping a tokenizer vocabulary array used to issue one unbuffered
  syscall per string (up to ~150k per header); parsing semantics
  unchanged;
- the API model-card cache is keyed by path+size+mtime (a same-size
  rewrite used to serve stale metadata) and bounded (512 entries).

## 9. Concurrency

No new goroutines were introduced. The only new concurrency primitive
is the cache's in-flight map (mutex-protected, WaitGroup-synchronised;
compute happens without the lock). The full race suite passes:
`-race` on agent, llm, api, native/engine, contextcache, memory,
attachments and recall, plus the new concurrent cache/memory/retrieval
tests.

## 10. Benchmarks (measured, before vs after)

Environment: 2-vCPU Linux container, Go 1.27.1. Same-binary comparison
for the chunker (legacy algorithm compiled next to the new one);
baseline worktree at commit dc4172c for memory/recall. Median of 5:

| Benchmark | Before | After | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| chunk derivation — 512×4 KiB chunks of a 5.5 MB source (includes sha256 + metadata + preview) | 5.77 ms/op · 10.91 MB/op · 4880 allocs | 3.64 ms/op · 2.46 MB/op · 4880 allocs | 1.6× faster · 4.4× fewer bytes |
| memory.Search — 5000-entry store | 7.40 ms/op · 7.67 MB/op · 172 allocs | 3.24 ms/op · 1.53 MB/op · 90 allocs | 2.3× faster · 5× fewer bytes |
| recall.Search — 5000-capsule corpus | 4.78 ms/op · 5.46 MB/op · 15160 allocs | 2.37 ms/op · 3.17 MB/op · 124 allocs | 2.0× faster · 122× fewer allocs |
| contextcache.GetOrCompute hit | — | 20.9 ns/op · 0 allocs | hit path is allocation-free |

Structural wins not visible in micro-benchmarks: per-retrieval object
reads drop from N(selected chunks) to ≤1 per attachment (verified by
test); binary/image staging peak RAM drops from the full file size
(≤64 MiB) to ≤16 KiB + one copy buffer; remember→recall cycles no
longer re-parse the memory file.

## 11. Tests added

- `internal/chunking/chunker_test.go`: legacy-equivalence (ASCII
  byte-identical), lossless reconstruction, determinism, metadata
  integrity (hash/offset/total/version round-trip), UTF-8 hard splits,
  max-chunks cap, overlap re-inclusion + termination, benchmarks;
- `internal/contextcache/contextcache_phase3_test.go`: compute-once,
  16-goroutine coalescing, panic propagation + recovery, oversized
  rejection (Put and GetOrCompute), cross-key parallelism, exact
  insert accounting, hit-path benchmark;
- `internal/attachments/attachments_phase3_test.go`: 6 MB staging +
  retrieval, identical-content cache reuse (chunksBuilt unchanged),
  changed-content invalidation, single object read per call, degraded
  range-read path, measured retrieval stats, binary never fully
  buffered, concurrent retrieval;
- `internal/memory/memory_phase3_test.go`: appends cause zero full
  re-parses, search correctness after append/clear/re-append,
  incremental delete, external-writer visibility, cache non-mutation,
  concurrent append+search race, 5000-entry benchmark;
- `internal/recall/recall_phase3_test.go`: BM25 scoring identical to a
  tf-map reference implementation, distinct-count integrity, clear
  resets caches, 5000-capsule benchmark.

## Known limitations (Phase 3, by design)

- Retrieval scoring still ranks on chunk previews (cheap first pass);
  this was a deliberate v1.1.3Z design, not changed here.
- The native engine still does NOT generate tokens — Phase 2 model
  loading is untouched; generation remains llama.cpp.
- No semantic/structural repository retrieval exists (nothing in this
  phase implements embeddings or an index beyond the existing BM25 and
  lexical scorers).
- No new config surface: the phase reuses existing limits; nothing was
  added to the settings UI or the wire API.

# v1.1.5Z Phase 2 Implementation Log (2026-09-10)

## Goal

Make the SHEYTAN Native Engine load a real supported GGUF model in C++:
read its metadata, validate it, plan its memory requirements and expose
real model information to Go — WITHOUT redesigning the Phase 1 Go↔C++
boundary. Generation stays on llama.cpp in this phase (explicitly).

```text
Go Core → SHEYTAN Native API → shtn-engine-host → C++ Native Engine → GGUF model
```

## Phase 1 verification (before any change)

The Phase 1 implementation was verified FIRST on the base commit
(`f4488d5`, v1.1.5Z-phase1): C++ build + 3/3 ctest, `go build`/`go vet`,
22 Go packages pass, race tests pass, `TestRealCppHostEndToEnd` passes,
npm typecheck/lint/build pass, stress 30/30, release-version --check
PASS. Only then did Phase 2 work begin.

## 1. Versioned protocol/ABI extension (no boundary redesign)

Protocol v1 → **v2** and ABI v1 → **v2**, bumped together on both sides
(`include/shtn/version.h` + `internal/native/engine/protocol.go` /
`backend.go ABIVersionExpected`). The handshake still fails closed on
mismatch. Pre-existing ops (ping/health/hwinfo/metrics/cancel/shutdown)
kept their exact wire shapes — the change is purely additive:

- wire ops `load_model` (payload `{path, contextLength?}`),
  `unload_model`, `model_info`;
- C ABI functions `shtn_engine_load_model` / `shtn_engine_unload_model` /
  `shtn_engine_model_info` / `shtn_engine_memory_plan` with new fixed-size
  structs (`shtn_model_load_options`, `shtn_model_info`,
  `shtn_memory_plan`) and new error codes appended (never renumbered):
  `SHTN_ERR_MODEL_FORMAT` / `SHTN_ERR_MODEL_STATE` / `SHTN_ERR_NO_MODEL`.

## 2. Native GGUF reader (native/engine/src/gguf.*)

Dependency-free, mmap-backed, hostile-input-hardened:

- magic + version validation (v2/v3 — the llama.cpp-supported set; v1
  and >3 rejected with a readable error);
- metadata parsing with bounds on every count/length (KV count ≤ 16384,
  string ≤ 16 MiB, array elements ≤ 100M, tensor count ≤ 1M, dims ≤ 8);
  unknown value types rejected; `general.alignment` validated (power of
  two, ≤ 4096) and honored for the data-section start;
- array VALUES are never materialized (the tokenizer vocab array is
  walked length-prefix-only; its element count feeds the vocab-size
  fallback);
- tensor table: per-tensor dims bounds, overflow-checked element
  products (a dims product that overflows uint64 is a hard reject),
  offsets validated against the data section, exact byte-size checks for
  known GGML types (ggml_nbytes formula: last dim padded to block size),
  lenient in-range checks only for types this build does not know;
- every arithmetic that could overflow goes through checked_add/mul —
  wrap-around is impossible by construction;
- the reader touches ONLY header pages (no full-file reads, no copying).

## 3. Model lifecycle + memory planning (native/engine/src/model.*)

- state machine: `unloaded → loading → loaded | failed → unloaded`, one
  mutex-protected model slot per engine; loads serialize, inspections
  run concurrently against stable snapshots;
- load = validate path → whole-file read-only mmap (POSIX mmap / Windows
  CreateFileMapping; lazy, no eager copy) → parse + validate → metadata
  extraction → memory plan → `loaded`. Replace semantics (load while
  loaded unloads first), all-or-nothing (a failed load leaves NOTHING
  loaded, mapping and handle released on every path);
- caller-argument errors (empty path, reserved field) leave the state
  unchanged (nothing was attempted); file-level failures (missing file,
  parse errors, zero-tensor files) walk to `failed` with the reason
  recorded;
- unload is idempotent; engine destroy releases the mapping;
- memory plan (computed, NOTHING allocated): model file / mapped bytes /
  weights (tensor-data span = file − data start) / workspace estimate
  (context·vocab·4 logits row) / KV-cache estimate
  (2·K/V·layers·context·embedding·2 bytes f16) / fixed 64 MiB runtime
  allowance / overflow-checked total / fit-vs-detected-RAM verdict
  (1/0/-1). Inputs missing from the file → that component is an honest 0.

## 4. Go side (internal/native/engine)

- `model.go` is now REAL: `Engine.LoadModel` / `Engine.UnloadModel` /
  `Engine.ModelInfo` drive the IPC ops with a dedicated model-state
  machine (`unloaded/loading/loaded/failed`) — deliberately separate
  from the engine states (`llm.State*`), no second engine-state system;
- the model snapshot RESETS on every host lifecycle boundary (start,
  restart, deliberate stop, death): a fresh host maps nothing, so stale
  state cannot survive;
- load ops use a bounded 30 s window (metadata-only parse, but cold
  slow disks deserve headroom) plus the caller ctx;
- `backend.go` maps the native card onto the shared `llm.ModelInfo`
  contract — additive fields (`State`, `FileSizeBytes`, `TensorCount`,
  `GGUFVersion`, `VocabSize`, `EmbeddingLength`, `LayerCount`,
  KV/workspace/total memory estimates) that the llama path leaves zero;
  `llm.FormatParameterCount` shared with the llama card formatter;
- metrics op additionally reports `modelState` (observability only);
- `GenerationCapable()` stays FALSE: loading is not generating.
  Generate/StreamGenerate still return `llm.ErrNotImplemented` and
  `llm.SelectGenerationBackend` still resolves to llama.cpp — pinned by
  tests.

## 5. Tests added

C++ (`ctest`, 5 suites now):

- `test_gguf` — valid v2/v3 files, custom alignment, malformed magic,
  unsupported versions (1 and 4), truncated files (empty / magic-only /
  counts cut / metadata cut / tensor-table cut / missing data section),
  hostile counts/lengths/types/alignment, invalid tensor entries
  (out-of-range offset, exact-size overflow, zero dim, dim-count bounds,
  dims-product overflow), checked arithmetic, metadata helpers;
- `test_model` — fresh-engine unloaded state, NULL/invalid-argument
  rejection, load→info→plan correctness (exact KV/workspace/total
  values), context-override planning, load A → load A again → load B
  replace semantics, unload/reload/idempotent unload, failed-load
  recovery (garbage file, zero-tensor file), destroy-with-loaded-model,
  concurrent safe inspection (4 inspectors + load/unload churn thread);
- `test_engine` / `test_host` extended: ABI v2 pins, model-surface NULL
  checks, fresh-engine `model_info` op, load/unload round trips through
  the dispatch loop, malformed-payload bounded errors, host-survives
  checks.

The whole C++ suite also passes under AddressSanitizer (no leaks, no
out-of-bounds access in the reader or the lifecycle).

Go:

- `model_test.go` — fake-host lifecycle matrix (load A / load A again /
  load B / unload / reload / failed load), validation ordering, bounded
  caller-ctx load, state resets across stop/start, concurrent inspection
  (race-detector target);
- `cpp_integration_test.go` — `TestRealCppHostModelLifecycle`: a real
  GGUF v3 file is built byte-by-byte in the test, loaded through the
  REAL C++ reader via the real host, metadata + derived parameter count
  + memory plan verified exactly, unload/reload/failed-load/recovery
  exercised, and the `llm.ModelInfo` mapping checked end-to-end;
- `engine_test.go` — fake host grew model ops (including loadfail /
  loadslow modes) mirroring the v2 wire shapes.

```

## Known limitations (Phase 2, by design)

- **No native inference.** Loading a model does NOT enable generation:
  Generate/StreamGenerate return `ErrNotImplemented`,
  GenerationCapable() is false, and every generation request runs on
  llama.cpp. Do not "fix" that by faking inference.
- The memory plan is arithmetic on parsed metadata (weights span, f16 KV
  estimate, logits-row workspace, fixed overhead allowance) — real
  allocation behavior arrives with the inference phase.
- GGUF v1 containers and GGML tensor types unknown to this build's size
  table are rejected or validated leniently (offset-in-range only),
  never guessed.
- The context override plans memory only; no context buffers exist yet.
- The native host binary is still not shipped or auto-downloaded; build
  it from `native/engine/` and place it in `{DataDir}/bin/` (or
  `nativeEnginePath`).
- SIGBUS risk if a mapped file shrinks mid-flight is inherent to mmap
  consumers (llama.cpp has the same property); files are opened
  read-only and nothing in SHEYTAN writes to model files.

# v1.1.5Z Phase 1 Implementation Log (2026-09-10)

## Goal

Establish the SHEYTAN Native AI Engine architecture:

```text
React/TypeScript → Wails → Go Core → SHEYTAN Native API → C++ Native Engine
```

Go remains the main application/runtime engine; the C++ engine becomes
the future heavy-compute/AI execution engine. llama.cpp stays functional
as the fallback throughout.

## 1. LLM backend abstraction (internal/llm)

`llm.Backend` formalizes the engine surface the rest of SHEYTAN depends
on: `Start / Stop / Health / LoadModel / UnloadModel / Generate /
StreamGenerate / Cancel / ModelInfo / HardwareInfo / Metrics`, plus
shared contract types (`HealthReport`, `ModelSpec`, `ModelInfo`,
`HardwareInfo` — the platform-neutral hardware profile —, `Metrics`) and
the error vocabulary (`ErrNotImplemented`, `ErrCancelContextBased`).

`llm.LlamaBackend` adapts the EXISTING pieces (LlamaServer + Client) to
the contract — a delegation layer, not a second engine: streaming,
retries, the stall watchdog, cancellation, busy reporting, engine events
and the config snapshot contract are untouched. Additive surface on
LlamaServer: `StartedAt()`, `Restarts()` (measured values for metrics)
and `ProbeHealth()` (a real bounded `/health` GET — the same endpoint the
startup ladder polls).

`llm.SelectGenerationBackend` is the single routing point: the native
engine serves generation only when selected AND
`GenerationCapable()`; otherwise llama.cpp. In Phase 1 the native backend
reports generation-incapable, so generation always resolves to llama.cpp
— pinned by tests so Phase 2 flips routing by implementing generation,
not by editing call sites.

## 2. Native engine package (internal/native/engine)

Concern layout (files): `protocol.go` (framing + ops + validation),
`runtime.go` (supervision), `backend.go` (`llm.Backend` adapter),
`platform.go` (hardware profile assembly), `metrics.go`,
`model.go`/`memory.go`/`kv.go`/`generation.go`/`scheduler.go` (Phase 1
concern types — the future data model, no fake inference).

- **Protocol**: 4-byte LE length-prefixed JSON over the host's
  stdin/stdout; 1 MiB frame cap; ops `ping/health/hwinfo/metrics/cancel/
  shutdown`; malformed frames rejected as protocol violations; request/
  response multiplexer with per-op timeouts (10 s) and serialized writers.
- **Supervision**: spawn (sanitized environment — no secrets cross the
  boundary) → protocol+ABI handshake (fails closed on mismatch) → health
  → ready; event-driven exit watcher (no polling, no busy loops); bounded
  auto-restart (3 recoveries per supervision episode, 1/2/4 s backoff,
  deliberate stops suppressed, terminal failure visible). Native engine
  state uses the SAME vocabulary and event shape as llama.cpp
  (`llm.State*`, `llm.EngineEvent`) — no second state system.
- **Hardware profile**: native probe (C++ detected values) merged with
  the sysinfo probe (GPU/VRAM); `DetectedBy` records each source; NPU/
  accelerator and shared-memory GPU fields are representable but stay
  empty until a detector exists.
- **Metrics**: only measured values — engine state, pid, uptime, restarts
  (Go side) + the C++ engine's own process RSS and uptime; generation
  metrics (TTFT, prompt/decode speed) are OMITTED until a backend
  actually serves generation.

## 3. C++ native engine skeleton (native/engine/)

Buildable independently (CMake ≥ 3.16 or plain make; C++17; ZERO
third-party dependencies):

- `include/shtn/{engine,types,version}.h` — the narrow C ABI: engine
  create/destroy, health, hardware info, metrics, ABI version. Opaque
  handle, fixed-size C structs, error codes instead of exceptions.
- `src/engine.cpp` — the engine core (state, uptime, hardware cache,
  measured metrics).
- `src/hardware.cpp` — real platform detection (Linux /proc + sysconf,
  Windows cpuid + GLPI + GlobalMemoryStatusEx + psapi, macOS sysctl +
  mach) with per-platform #ifdef paths.
- `src/{protocol,json}.cpp` — framing + a careful minimal JSON
  parser/serializer (escape-safe, nesting-aware, hostile-input-safe).
- `src/host_main.cpp` — `shtn-engine-host`: the supervised subprocess;
  one request frame in → one response frame out; malformed input gets a
  bounded error response (never a crash, never an exit); `shutdown`
  acknowledges and exits cleanly; stdin EOF exits cleanly.
- `tests/` — `test_engine` (ABI contract: create/destroy, NULL
  rejection, ABI mismatch, health, hwinfo, metrics monotonicity),
  `test_protocol` (framing, caps, truncation, JSON edge cases),
  `test_host` (dispatch: valid ops, unknown ops, garbage inputs, oversized
  frames, shutdown, EOF).

## 4. Go↔C++ boundary decision

**B) supervised native subprocess + IPC** (documented in
`internal/native/engine/doc.go` and ARCHITECTURE.md §I.9): crash
isolation (a native crash cannot kill the app; the bounded watchdog
restarts it), preserved `CGO_ENABLED=0` Windows cross-build, future
Android maps to a service process, explicit versioned protocol, and
coarse-grained ops only (the boundary never carries tiny high-frequency
calls). Verified end-to-end by `TestRealCppHostEndToEnd` (Go Engine ↔
real C++ host: handshake, health, hardware, metrics, cancel, clean stop).

## 5. llama.cpp preserved (fallback contract)

- llama.cpp remains the DEFAULT engine (`engineBackend: "llama"`) — the
  entire v1.1.4Z behavior is unchanged unless the user explicitly opts in.
- With `engineBackend: "native"`: the native engine is supervised
  (lifecycle real), generation still runs on llama.cpp (native reports
  generation-incapable), and native failures NEVER fail the llama path
  (best-effort, logged, visible in the engine snapshot).
- The engine toggle (POST /api/llama start/stop) drives both engines when
  native is enabled; llama's state stays the authoritative action result.
- `/api/engine` snapshot gains `backend` (effective generation backend)
  and a `native` status block (local reads only — the poll path performs
  NO engine IPC); native transitions broadcast into the existing WS
  pipeline with "Native engine …" captions; the UI badge keeps reading
  the llama snapshot state.
- Config: `engineBackend` (exact-match opt-in, fail-closed to llama on
  malformed values; normalized on load), `nativeEnginePath` (optional
  override). Consumed by runtime wiring + selection; no Settings UI
  control in Phase 1 (config.json / `SHEYTAN_ENGINE_BACKEND` env are the
  opt-in paths — a toggle whose only visible effect would be a process in
  Task Manager is feature theater).

## 6. Validation performed (this release)

version smoke: "SHEYTAN-Local-Agent v1.1.5"            PASS
```

New tests added:

- `internal/llm/backend_test.go` — selection matrix (default llama /
  native-incapable fallback / native-capable (Phase 2 shape) / native
  absent / malformed values fail closed / no-probe backends), llama
  backend delegation, cancel semantics, metrics (measured values only),
  hardware from sysinfo, model validation, contract constants.
- `internal/native/engine/engine_test.go` — protocol framing/validation;
  lifecycle (start→ready, stop walk, events, missing binary → failed);
  failure (crash → bounded restart ladder → terminal failed, garbage
  host → connection loss detection, slow host → bounded teardown);
  cancellation (cancel round-trip miss with reason, op timeouts);
  concurrent lifecycle (race-clean); hardware merge; measured metrics;
  backend contract (ErrNotImplemented for generation, GenerationCapable
  false, LoadModel validates first); model spec path jail.
- `internal/native/engine/cpp_integration_test.go` — end-to-end against
  the real C++ host binary (skips when not built).
- `internal/api/server_native_test.go` — engine snapshot (default: no
  native block; native selected: honest unavailable status, backend stays
  llama), engine toggle behavior unchanged (500 on missing binary exactly
  as v1.1.4Z).

## Known limitations (Phase 1, by design)

- **No native inference.** Generate/StreamGenerate/LoadModel/ModelInfo
  return `ErrNotImplemented` on the native backend; every generation
  request runs on llama.cpp. This is the honest fallback signal — do not
  "fix" it by faking inference.
- The native host binary is not shipped or auto-downloaded; it must be
  built from `native/engine/` (CMake or Make) and placed in
  `{DataDir}/bin/` (or `nativeEnginePath`).
- The C++ hardware probe does not enumerate GPUs/accelerators (the Go
  side merges sysinfo for real GPU facts; the profile fields exist and
  stay empty until a detector does).
- The Wails/GTK desktop build still cannot compile in the Linux CI-less
  environment (pre-existing; Windows CI builds it).
- llama.cpp watchdog semantics (budget resets after a successful
  restart) are intentionally UNTOUCHED; the native engine uses a stricter
  episode policy (auto-restarts never reset the budget — a persistently
  crashing native host gives up after 3 recoveries).

# v1.1.4Z Windows CI repair (2026-09-07, post-release)

The `Windows x64` job of the `Build Desktop` workflow failed at the
`Verify release metadata` step with:

```text
A positional parameter cannot be found that accepts argument '1.1.4\'.
```

## Root cause

The step reused **Bash-style `\"` escaping inside PowerShell strings**:

```powershell
-Pattern "AppVersion  = \"$env:APP_VERSION\""   # invalid in PowerShell
```

PowerShell terminates the string at the quote after the backslash, the
`-Pattern` argument splits into extra positional tokens, and parameter
binding fails on the fragment `1.1.4\`. The release metadata itself was
never wrong — `node scripts/release-version.mjs` succeeded and all four
surfaces were in sync. Reproduced locally with pwsh 7.4.6 executing the
verbatim step script: identical error, exit 1.

## Second (latent) defect fixed in the same step

`Select-String ... | Out-Null` **exits 0 when nothing matches**. Even with
correct quoting, a mismatched release surface would have passed the gate
silently (verified by test: wrong version, exit 0). The repaired step uses
`-Quiet` and throws on a false result, so a metadata mismatch now fails
the job loudly.

## Fix

`Windows x64` job, `Verify release metadata` step: rewritten with
PowerShell-native single-quoted literals plus explicit concatenation
(no escaping needed), `-SimpleMatch` retained, all four release surfaces
checked in a data-driven loop, expectations derived from
`$env:APP_VERSION` (version-agnostic, no hard-coded version). The bash
`grep -F` equivalents in the audit and Linux jobs were already correct
and untouched.

## Verification performed (this repair)

- The exact step script (extracted verbatim from the workflow YAML)
  executed with pwsh 7.4.6 against the real repository files:
  10/10 checks — correct metadata passes; wrong `APP_VERSION` fails;
  corrupted `SIGNATURE` fails; version bump to 1.1.5 through the release
  machinery passes and restores cleanly; no `\"` artifacts remain
  anywhere in the workflow.
- `node scripts/release-version.mjs` and `--check`: all four surfaces
  consistent, no drift, byte-preserving sync intact.
- Full suite re-run after the change: `go build`/`go vet` headless,
  `go test -tags headless ./internal/...` (21 packages),
  `-race` on agent/llm/api, full headless tree, `npm ci`/typecheck/lint
  (0 warnings)/build, stress suite 30/0, releasegate — all green.
- `zeta_release_surface` stress contract still pins the workflow shape;
  no contract fragment was touched.

## Repository consistency cleanups shipped with the repair

- `web/static`: the committed tree carried a stale duplicate generation of
  hashed assets and a `manifest.json` pointing at the old generation while
  `index.html` referenced the new one. A clean `npm run build` +
  `scripts/sync-web.mjs` removes the 8 stale files and corrects the
  manifest; the runtime entry (`index.html` + referenced assets) is
  byte-identical.
- Documentation audit (new `ARCHITECTURE.md`, updates to `README.md`,
  `agent.md`, this file, `FIX-README.md`): every capability statement is
  now labeled with the truth standard (IMPLEMENTED / TESTED / PARTIALLY
  IMPLEMENTED / PLANNED), the small-models/multi-agent/Context-Engine
  direction is recorded as future architecture, `internal/multiagent` is
  documented (it was implemented and CLI-wired but absent from the
  package map), and two overstated claims were corrected
  ("semantic chunking" → paragraph-boundary chunking; "checksum-verified
  publication" → integrity-checked publication via ZIP CRC + entry
  contracts — the SHA256 steps left the workflow during earlier
  refactors).

# v1.1.4Z Remediation Log (2026-09-07)

## Audit scope and method

Full-repository inspection before any modification: every Go package (52k+ LOC), the React/TS frontend, CI workflow, build/release scripts, docs and tests. Six subsystem maps were produced (llm, agent+api, tools+lab+sandbox, research+memory+updater, config+cmd+CI, frontend) and every suspected dead/defective path was verified by reference tracing before removal. Baseline validation before changes: build, vet and all test packages green on `main` @ `79c710c` (v1.1.3).

## 1. Concurrency and state integrity

| Fix | Defect | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| **Config data race** | `mergeConfigPatch` wrote `*s.cfg = updated` in place while run goroutines, the engine manager and the client read the same struct — a genuine `-race` class defect | `internal/config.Source`: copy-on-write holder (RWMutex, `Load/Store/Update`). Patch handler, engine compat writes, engine-tag writes and the update loop all publish through it; runs and requests snapshot once and stay consistent for their duration |
| **Orchestrator races** | tool map read/written without a lock; `SetSessionID` clobbered between concurrent runs; per-iteration config reads could flip policy mid-turn | RWMutex-guarded registry with `tool()` lookup; per-run config snapshot |
| **MarkBusy window** | aliveness checked under `mu`, transition applied after unlock — a death in between could be overwritten by a stale `busy`/`ready` | `setStateLocked` — the whole transition is atomic |
| **busyHook write race** | `Client.SetBusyHook` wrote a plain field that streaming reads raced | RWMutex-guarded |
| **MultiAgent struct mutation** | `Run` defaulted `m.maxIter` on the shared struct | local variable |
| **Termshell engine** | shared instance with unlocked `cwd`/`history`/`env` | mutex on `Exec` |
| **Stack.Browser lazy cache** | unlocked field write | `browserMu` |
| **Config persistence** | plain `WriteFile` (a crash mid-write truncated config.json) | atomic tmp+rename |

Regression tests: `TestSourceConcurrentReadWrite`, `TestConfigPatchIsRaceFree` (both run under `-race`).

## 2. Engine / LLM layer

| Fix | Defect | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| **Engine download hang** | plain `http.Get` (no timeout, no cap) could hold `switchMu` forever | 10-minute context + 2 GiB cap on `downloadAndExtract` |
| **`ListLoadedModels` hang** | plain `http.Get` from an HTTP handler | 5-second client |
| **Streaming truncation** | a single 10-minute `http.Client.Timeout` covered the whole SSE body — long generations were silently cut, while stalled streams hung until it fired | dedicated stream client (no overall timeout, 2-minute header timeout) + **stall watchdog**: request-context cancel after 5 minutes with zero bytes (adaptive tick); `TestStreamStallWatchdogAbortsQuietStream` pins it |
| **Silent retry exhaustion** | the final give-up after 4 attempts was never logged | logged to `llm.jsonl` on both Chat and Stream paths |
| **Vestigial stateCh** | legacy channel written non-blocking, never read | removed (with `publishEvent`, folded into `setStateLocked`) |

## 3. Functional completion (documented-but-unwired subsystems)

Every item below was fully implemented and unit-tested in the repository but had **no production caller** — the exact "feature theater" class this release eliminates:

| Subsystem | Previous state | v1.1.4Z |
|---|---|---|
| **GGUF model cards** (`llm/gguf.go`) | complete parser, zero callers; `/api/models` shipped stat-only entries while the docs promised architecture/quantization/context | wired into `/api/models` with an mtime-keyed cache; parser now tested |
| **Sampling settings** | `minP`, `repeatLastN`, `presencePenalty`, `frequencyPenalty`, `mirostatTau/Eta` editable in Settings, never sent anywhere | sent per-request (OpenAI-standard fields to all providers; llama.cpp-only fields local-gated) and as engine launch flags |
| **Sandbox settings** | `sandboxEnabled/Memory/CPU` stored but ignored (runtime hardcoded 512 MB / 25 %; the toggle lied — the sandbox was ALWAYS on while the config said off) | wired: the toggle gates registration, memory/CPU feed the governor with parsed/clamped effective getters; default ON (fail closed) |
| **ShowPerfHUD** | collected telemetry never reached any UI | emits a `perf` activity event with the HUD line |
| **Continuum rollover** | distillation/chapters/framework sidecars implemented + tested since v1.0.7; only the pressure meter was live | wired after each run: threshold check → deterministic distill → new chapter session → `session` activity event; the frontend follows the thread automatically |
| **Recall feedback** | `SetFeedback`/`FeedbackFor` and the liked×1.25/disliked×0.6 steering existed since v1.0.6 with no write path | `/api/feedback` endpoint + 👍/👎 on assistant messages in the conversation view (optimistic, with revert on failure) |
| **Scheduled engine updates** | `updater.RunScheduled` (immediate pass when due + 6 h re-check) had zero callers — "update (scheduled: daily/…)" only ever meant manual runs | started in `Server.EnsureSetup` (Source-aware; `off`/`never` disables) |
| **BMP images** | `.bmp` accepted by discovery, rejected by the encoder | BMP decode via `x/image/bmp` |
| **Sampling presets** | served, loaded into the store, never rendered or applied | model metadata now surfaced in the model picker; preset data remains available for the sampling card |

## 4. Security

| Fix | Defect class | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| **DNS rebinding (fetch)** | URL validation + DNS pre-resolution, but the dialer re-resolved the name — a rebinding answer slipped past | `pinnedPublicDialContext`: resolve → validate public → **dial the verified IP** (TLS keeps the original hostname) |
| **Zip-slip (updater)** | `extractZip` joined member names unvalidated | `safeZipPath` (absolute/volume/`..` rejected) + per-entry and total size caps; tested at both the path and archive layers |
| **Sandbox secret exposure** | `codeExec` ran with the FULL `os.Environ()` — model-generated python could read host API keys | `proc.SanitizedEnvironment` (shared with the Lab runner) |
| **Lab expansion escape** | lexical policy passed `$HOME/secret`, `~/x`, `${VAR}/x`, `%USERPROFILE%\x` while the shell resolved them outside the jail | expansion-token rejection + `HOME`/`USERPROFILE`/`TMPDIR` pinned to the workspace in the sanitized env |
| **WebSearch redirects** | used `http.DefaultClient` (any scheme/host on redirect) | dedicated client: ≤5 hops, http(s) only, no credentials |
| **Diagnostics leakage** | `tools.jsonl`/`llm.jsonl` shipped unredacted in the diagnostics zip (tool args can contain secrets) | redaction applied; `redact` extended to JSON members and env-style `key=value` |
| **SSRF test seam** | production-file bypass setter on an unsynchronized global | atomic `Bool` |
| **Unbounded bodies** | most JSON endpoints accepted arbitrary request sizes | `MaxBytesReader` on config (1 MB), sessions PUT (1 MB), research (64 KB), lab (256 KB), llama/abort (4 KB) |
| **Abort no-op** | malformed abort body returned `{ok:true}` while aborting nothing | 400 with the decode error |

## 5. Reliability, errors, resources

- **Per-run time budget** (`runTimeoutMinutes`, default 60, clamp 1–1440, 0 = off): a run was previously bounded only by `maxIterations` and per-call timeouts — a pathological turn could hold the run slot for hours. Timeout is distinguished from user abort in the end caption.
- **Swallowed persistence failures surfaced**: pre-run `Save` (user message could silently vanish), `AppendMessage` (a generated reply could be lost with no visible error), `AppendActivity`, `IndexTurn` — all now log, and reply loss emits a visible error activity.
- **netcheck worst case** 17.5 s → ~2.5 s (parallel probes; the sequential version stalled offline users on the engine-start gate).
- **Unbounded growth bounded**: recall index (5000-capsule retention, atomic rewrite), browser screenshots (keep 50), crash reports (keep 20), memory reads cached by (size, mtime) instead of re-parsing the file per tool call.
- **sysinfo on Windows 11 24H2+**: CIM via PowerShell first, `wmic` fallback; free-memory probe added.

## 6. Frontend

| Fix | Defect | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| **createSession dead composer** | only prepended the session + set the id: the socket stayed bound to the OLD session (the stale guard then discarded every event for the new one) and state was never reset — the first message on a fresh session never streamed and `running` stuck true | full reset + socket rebind (mirrors `selectSession`) |
| **deleteSession stale view** | the deleted session's conversation stayed on screen | state cleared + `loadSession` for the newly active session |
| **No WS reconnect** | any mid-run disconnect permanently killed event delivery (`running` could never clear) | exponential-backoff auto-reconnect (1.5 s → 15 s, 20 attempts, reset on success) |
| **Activity captions** | the activity feed read `data.message/content/text` — the backend populates `caption`; every event rendered as a bare type label | `caption`-first formatter |
| **Engine poll leak** | the 2.5 s `/api/engine` poll ran for the app lifetime once started | `stopEnginePolling` + unmount cleanup |
| **Unhandled rejections** | Lab/Research store actions rethrew to fire-and-forget callers | state carries the error; no rethrow |
| **Two engine-state sources** | the Start/Stop toggle read `models.llamaRunning` while the badge read `engine.state` — they could disagree | both follow the authoritative `engine.state` |
| **Model picker** | filename-only labels | GGUF metadata (quant, params) in the option labels |
| Dead exports | 12 legacy wrappers + a legacy WS client + dead types removed; unused deps (`clsx`, `lucide-react`) removed | — |

## 7. Dead code removed (verified no references before deletion)

`llm`: `stateCh`, `publishEvent`, `ApplyPreset`, `SwitchModel`, `LoadOrStartWithModel`, `EnsureRunning`, `ListRemoteModels` (+ `models.go`), 10 unused `ForTest` seams. `api`: `uploadTimeout`, `marshalAttachmentsSafe`, `parseIntDefault`. `config`: `ProMode`, `VerboseAgent` (meaningless settings). `browser`: `Session.Info`. `research`: `searxngMaxResults`. `logging`: `Recent`. `netcheck`: `Force`. `installer`: `lookPathImpl` indirection. `termshell`: `quote`. `tools`: import-keeper stubs. `cmd/stress`: two tautological scenarios + the hand-copied `simulateExtractJSON` (now uses the exported real parser). `humanBytes` ×3 → `internal/humanize`. `cmd` files reorganized to match their contents (`setup.go`, `logs.go`, `diagnostics.go`, `license.go`).

## 8. Release engineering

- **The release-job trap** (the single most dangerous defect in the pipeline): the release job was gated on hardcoded `refs/tags/v1.1.3Z` with hardcoded asset names — every version bump silently skipped release publication until someone hand-edited the workflow. Now: version-agnostic `v*` tag gate + a first step verifying `GITHUB_REF_NAME == v{APP_VERSION}Z`; all asset/artifact names derive from `APP_VERSION`.
- Version grep literals in the three build jobs derive from `APP_VERSION`/`$env:APP_VERSION` instead of hardcodes.
- `config.Save` atomic; `scripts/build-and-zip.sh` and launcher `.bat` versioned.

```

Known limitations (unchanged or newly documented):

- The Wails/GTK desktop build cannot compile in this environment (no GTK4/WebKit dev libs); the Windows CI job builds it (CGO-free cross-compile verified here).
- Vision (mmproj) path not exercised with a real projector model.
- Small instruct models may not emit formal tool calls; loop mechanics covered by deterministic tests.
- The API is loopback-only without an auth token — the OS user account is the trust boundary.
- The Lab command policy is lexical (denylists + env pinning), not a kernel sandbox.
- Agent tool calls execute sequentially by design.

# Historical: v1.1.3Z Implementation Log (AAA upgrade, 2026-09-04)

## What was implemented

1. Automatic engine lifecycle — `api.Server.EnsureSetup` calls `Stack.PrewarmLLM`; `handleRun` gates every run on `Stack.EnsureLLMContext` (bounded 3 min); cold starts stream engine transitions to the UI.
2. Engine state machine — spec states `idle/downloading/starting/ready/running/busy/stopping/stopped/failed`; `SubscribeEvents` fans transitions to the API layer; `MarkBusy` wired to inference windows; bounded watchdog auto-restart (3 attempts, 1/2/4 s backoff, stop-suppressed).
3. Attachments (`internal/attachments`) — content-addressed staging (sha256, symlink-safe, 0600), size/count/timeout/chunk caps, text normalization + stable chunk identity, lexical retrieval with provenance headers, image classification for the vision pipeline.
4. Context cache (`internal/contextcache`) — content-keyed LRU (entries + bytes), version + config-fingerprint keys, TTL, prefix invalidation, stats.
5. Long-context plan (`internal/contextplan`) — explicit budget (`numCtx` minus output reserve), sections system/tools/recall/attachments/history with priorities; tool specs measured exactly before windowing; overflow emits a visible error.
6. API surface — `GET /api/engine`, engine events on every activity WS, `/api/attachments` upload/list/inspect/delete, `/api/run` with attachment retrieval injection and regenerate.
7. Frontend — dead-composer fix (`running` resets on done/error), real conversation view, engine card on authoritative states, composer attachment tray.
8. Headless build tag — `desktop.go` gated `!headless`; `desktop/headless.go` serves the same stack; `go build/test -tags headless` works without GTK/WebKit.
9. Configuration correctness — local `EffectiveBaseURL` derives from `LlamaHost:LlamaPort` (legacy value migrates); default `numCtx` 8192 → 16384 (measured: briefing + full tool schemas ≈ 9.8k tokens).
10. Tests — contextcache/attachments/contextplan/llm (real spawn + fake engine re-exec)/agent (fake SSE)/sessions/api suites.

## Runtime verification performed (v1.1.3Z)

- Stub-engine e2e: 16/16 PASS — launch, auto-start, ready, session, upload, run with attachment, engine envelope, regenerate, cache stats, shutdown.
- REAL engine e2e: llama.cpp b10642 (linux x64, CPU) + Qwen2.5-0.5B/1.5B Instruct GGUF: automatic startup to ready (~5 s), real inference streamed and persisted, busy → ready, regenerate.
- The oversized-request failure (9854 tok vs 8192 ctx) was reproduced against the real engine, root-caused, fixed and re-verified.
