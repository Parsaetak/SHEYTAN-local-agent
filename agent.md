# SHEYTAN-Local-Agent — Agent Context

> Persistent engineering handoff for the next agent working on this repository.

Repository: https://github.com/Parsaetak/SHEYTAN-local-agent

Branch: `main`

Current release: `v1.1.5Z` (SHEYTAN Native AI Engine — Phase 5: REAL native transformer inference + generation + streaming + cancellation + measured metrics for the llama architecture; llama.cpp remains the fallback — see `worklog.md` for the full Phase 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 logs).

**Read `worklog.md` before working.** It records the audit findings and the fixes this release shipped, including which subsystems were previously unwired and why.

**Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the implementation truth table and the validated future direction.** Its Part II records the planned architecture (small local models, tiered model routing, the Context Engine, context budgeting, multi-agent, artifact-based communication, document editing). None of that is implemented — never present it as current capability. Its Part III defines the documentation truth standard every change must follow.

# 1. Mission

SHEYTAN-Local-Agent is a local-first AI software-engineering environment.

Core principle:

> **The model proposes. The tools execute. The laboratory verifies.**

The current mission is maintaining and deepening **verified runtime behavior** — not adding visual surface area. Every change must keep the full path working:

```text
desktop launch
  → automatic llama.cpp startup
  → real model readiness
  → inference (streaming, tools, budget)
  → attachments / chunking / cache / recall
  → continuum rollover on pressure
  → objective verification (Lab)
  → visible, honest result
```

# 2. Development rules

Before modifying anything:

```text
inspect live repository
verify exact main commit
inspect relevant source
verify actual runtime behavior
```

Never:

```text
assume a commit works
assume a successful build means functionality
assume a UI control is wired
assume engine state is true
claim success without evidence
claim a performance win without a before/after measurement
```

When the user says "done, check verify and continue":

```text
inspect → verify → diagnose → fix → retest → continue
```

# 3. Architecture (v1.1.5Z)

Backend: Go 1.26, Wails v3 (desktop shell), Go HTTP API + WebSocket on `127.0.0.1:8765`.

Engine stack (v1.1.5Z Phase 5 — the native engine performs REAL transformer inference for the llama architecture and serves REAL generation with streaming + cancellation + measured metrics; llama.cpp remains the default/fallback and serves every model the native engine cannot execute):

```text
React/TypeScript → Wails → Go Core → llm.Backend contract
                                    ├─ llama.cpp (default + fallback: tools, images,
                                    │             non-llama archs, unsupported tensors)
                                    └─ native backend (selected + GenerationCapable)
                                        → shtn-engine-host (supervised subprocess)
                                        → C++ engine: GGUF tokenizer → transformer
                                          forward pass (RMSNorm/RoPE/GQA/SwiGLU)
                                          → real logits → sampler → fp16 KV cache
                                          → decode loop → streamed chunks → metrics
```

Frontend: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Zustand; embedded via `web/static` (go:embed) — **`npm run build` must be re-run after any frontend change** so the embedded assets stay in sync.

# 4. Configuration: the Source contract

`config.Source` (internal/config/source.go) is the **only** sanctioned way to mutate live configuration:

- Values obtained from `Load()` are **immutable by contract** — never mutate them.
- Writers go through `Update`/`UpdateErr`/`Store` (copy → mutate → publish).
- Runs, requests and engine starts take ONE snapshot per operation.
- `updater.RunScheduled` runs `CheckAndApply` on a private copy and publishes back.

Violating this contract reintroduces the v1.1.3Z data race (`*s.cfg = updated` in the patch handler). `TestSourceConcurrentReadWrite` and `TestConfigPatchIsRaceFree` guard it under `-race` — keep them passing.

# 4b. Data-pipeline rules (v1.1.5Z Phase 3)

The local data path has one owner per stage — Source/Input → Loader →
Normalizer → Chunker (chunking.ChunkText) → Cache (contextcache) →
Retriever → Context Builder — and every stage keeps derived data
separate from sources and bounded:

- Chunk IDs/metadata are deterministic from content + processing
  parameters; bump `chunking.ProcessingVersion` AND
  `contextcache.Version` together when derivation changes shape.
- The cache is never a source of truth. Concurrent same-key work is
  coalesced by `contextcache.GetOrCompute`; a value above the per-entry
  bound is rejected, not stored.
- Memory-store search, recall search and attachment retrieval are
  measured (Store.ParseStats, cache Stats, ResourceUsage,
  RetrievalStats, plan PromptBytes). Log measured values only.
- Never trade a trust/security bound for speed: quarantine,
  authoritative-user-fact rules and path jails apply to the fast paths
  exactly as before.

# 5. Engine rules

- Engine state is backend-authoritative: `idle/downloading/starting/ready/running/busy/stopping/stopped/failed`. `ready`/`busy` are the reachable alive states; the UI must never invent any state. The native engine uses the SAME vocabulary and event shape (`llm.State*`, `llm.EngineEvent`) — there is no second state system; each engine owns its authoritative state and the API exposes one snapshot per engine.
- The engine start captures one config snapshot (a Settings PATCH mid-boot can no longer produce half-old/half-new launch flags).
- `MarkBusy` performs the whole transition under one lock — do not split it again (see `setStateLocked`).
- Streaming has NO overall client timeout by design; the stall watchdog (5 min zero-byte) provides the hang bound. Do not reintroduce a blanket `http.Client.Timeout` on the stream client.
- Engine downloads are context-bounded (10 min) and size-capped (2 GiB).
- v1.1.5Z Phase 5 backend rules: generation is routed by `llm.SelectGenerationBackend` (wired through the orchestrator's generation router — `Stack.streamGeneration`) — the native engine only when selected (`engineBackend: "native"`) AND `GenerationCapable()` (alive + a loaded model whose llama graph validated at load time); otherwise llama.cpp. Request shapes the native path cannot serve (tools, images) and pre-first-token native failures fall back to llama.cpp with the reason logged and inspectable. Native engine failures never fail the llama path (best-effort, logged, visible in `native.state`).
- Native MODEL loading (Phase 2) is real: `LoadModel` validates the file and loads it natively (GGUF validate → memory-map → metadata → memory plan). Model states use their own dedicated vocabulary — `unloaded/loading/loaded/failed` — separate from the engine states above; a host restart resets the model state (a fresh host maps nothing). Loading a model does NOT enable generation.
- v1.1.5Z Phase 5 native generation (REAL): the native engine performs the actual transformer computation for the llama architecture — token embeddings → per-layer RMSNorm → Q/K/V projection → RoPE → causal GQA attention over a REAL fp16 KV cache → output projection + residual → RMSNorm → SwiGLU FFN + residual → final norm → logits. The sampler consumes the REAL logits (temperature, top-k, top-p, repetition penalty, seed — the Phase 4 primitives). Generation streams coarse-grained chunks over IPC (one generate request → event frames → final frame; NEVER one frame per token), supports REAL cooperative cancellation (observed every token), stops honestly (EOS without emitting it / max_tokens / context bound / error) and reports MEASURED metrics only (prompt tokens, generated tokens, prefill time, TTFT, decode tok/s, KV positions — monotonic clock). The context bound is a REJECT policy: prompt+max_tokens beyond the context window fails explicitly (no silent truncation).
- Native generation support is NARROW and honest: architecture llama only; tensor types F32/F16/Q4_0/Q4_1/Q5_0/Q5_1/Q8_0 only; RoPE freq_scale 1.0 only; no chat-template interpretation (plain role-labeled prompt format — llama.cpp keeps template fidelity); tools/images requests return ErrNotImplemented (the router sends them to llama.cpp). A model outside the supported set loads fine but reports `generationCapable=false` with an inspectable reason; generation selection (`llm.SelectGenerationBackend` → native only when selected AND capable) then routes to llama.cpp. A native failure BEFORE the first streamed token falls back to llama.cpp with the reason logged; after the first token it surfaces like any engine error.
- The native KV cache now stores REAL fp16 bits (uint16_t, Phase 5 corrected the Phase 4 float[]-but-reported-f16 defect: capacity_bytes == the actual allocation, layer offsets exact, used_bytes consistent with written positions — pinned by regression tests). The cache allocates at the first generate (sized from model dims) and resets per request; `kv_cache_info` reports the measured population.
- The native scheduler runs a REAL single-slot worker thread (max concurrent = 1): queued/active/completed/cancelled/failed counts are real; the generation lane in the host keeps the dispatch loop responsive (cancel/metrics/shutdown while generating).
- Model loads now compute the llama-graph verdict (metadata-level: every required tensor present with the right shape and a supported type) and report `generationCapable` + `generationReason` in model_info. Pre-warm loads the selected model natively and logs the verdict; an incapable model keeps llama.cpp serving generation.
- The native engine host (`shtn-engine-host`) runs with a sanitized environment, bounded op timeouts (10 s; model loads 30 s), a 1 MiB frame cap and a protocol/ABI handshake that fails closed (protocol/ABI v4 — both sides bumped together; v4 adds the generate/cancel ops with streamed event frames + real cancellation to v3; generation runs on bounded lanes so the host stays responsive mid-generation; malformed generate payloads and host-side errors are bounded error frames, never crashes). Build it from `native/engine/` (CMake or Make); this phase does not ship or auto-download it.
- v1.1.5Z Phase 4 frontend perf contract: streaming model output is COALESCED through `flushStreaming` (rAF-boundary batching in `store.ts`). The UI updates at most once per frame regardless of token rate — a model emitting 200 tokens/sec no longer triggers 200 React renders/sec. Lifecycle events (done/error/session) bypass the coalescer and reset state immediately. A frame-budget diagnostic HUD (`src/perf-hud.ts`) is OFF by default — toggle with Ctrl+Shift+P or `window.__shtnTogglePerfHUD()`. The HUD measures real frame time, dropped frames, longtask count and coalesced stream-update frequency. The target budget is auto-detected from the display refresh rate (8.33 ms for 120 Hz, 16.67 ms for 60 Hz) — the HUD does NOT claim guaranteed 120 FPS; it reports `optimized for high-refresh displays / frame-budget aware / 120 Hz-capable presentation where hardware permits`.

# 6. Bounded-resource invariants

Every long-running operation must have: context cancellation, timeout, bounded output, cleanup. Current bounds to preserve:

```text
run time budget       runTimeoutMinutes (default 60, clamp 1..1440, 0=off)
engine watchdog       3 restarts/episode, 1/2/4s backoff
LLM retries           4 attempts (no retry after first emitted token)
stream stall          5 min zero-byte abort
lab output            2 MiB shared stdout+stderr
lab command timeout   ≤ 3600s     repair iterations ≤ 100
shell output          tool-level caps (64 KB simulator, 2 MB file reads)
attachments           manager-enforced size/count/chunk/processing caps;
                      staging is streaming (RAM ≈ 16 KiB head + 128 KiB
                      buffer, not the file size)
attachment chunks     ≤ 512 per file (bounded derived data)
retrieval objects     ≤ 32 MiB retained per retrieve call; larger objects
                      fall back to exact byte-range reads
context cache         entries + bytes + per-entry bound; single-flight;
                      oversized entries rejected, never retained
screenshots           50 kept     crash reports: 20 kept
WS hubs               128-event buffers, drop-on-slow (never block runs)
```

# 7. Security invariants (do not regress)

```text
loopback-only API + origin allow-list
path jail (traversal + symlink resolution) on every file tool
zip-slip-safe extraction with caps (llama.go AND updater)
fetch: URL validation + DNS pre-resolution + pinned dial IP
sandbox + lab: sanitized environment, HOME pinned to workspace
lab policy: dangerous/network/interactive/escape denylists
   (incl. $VAR/ ~/ %VAR% expansion tokens — see isExpandedPathToken)
secrets redacted: config GET, diagnostics zip, logs
```

Fail closed. Never weaken a control to unblock a feature.

# 8. Wired-surface contract (the v1.1.4Z lesson)

Before this release, several subsystems were fully implemented but had **zero production callers** (GGUF cards, continuum rollover, recall feedback, RunScheduled, sandbox settings, parts of sampling). The rule going forward:

> **A capability is either wired end-to-end (backend + API + UI + tests) or deleted. A stored-but-ignored setting is a defect.**

When adding a config field, grep for a consumer in the same change. When adding an endpoint, verify the frontend calls it (and vice versa).

# 9. Frontend contract

- The activity WebSocket reconnects automatically (exponential backoff); `done`/`error` always release the composer. Session create/delete rebind the socket and reset conversation state. If you touch session lifecycle, keep those invariants.
- `ActivityEvent.data.caption` is the display text (the backend `agent.Activity` contract) — formatters read caption first.
- The engine toggle AND the badge both read `engine.state` (never `models.llamaRunning`).
- The engine poll is stopped on view unmount.
- Recall feedback buttons send the exchange query (the user message preceding the reply) — the backend derives the same capsule id as `IndexTurn`.

python3 native/engine/tests/reference/make_fixture.py
# Measured performance evidence (prints the measured table):
go test -tags headless ./internal/native/engine/ -run TestPhase5Benchmark -count=1 -v
```

New runtime features need a regression test at the level where a real user would notice the failure (HTTP-level for API changes, request-shape tests for wire fields, behavioral tests for loop mechanics).

# 11. CI / release discipline

`.github/workflows/build-desktop.yml` is version-agnostic: the release job runs for any `v*` tag and verifies `GITHUB_REF_NAME == v{APP_VERSION}Z`. Version bumps flow from `package.json` via `node scripts/release-version.mjs` (syncs `config.go`, `build/config.yml`, `SIGNATURE`, workflow `APP_VERSION`). Hand-edit nothing else for a bump — then re-run the `--check`.

Do not reintroduce hardcoded version literals in the workflow (grep literals derive from `APP_VERSION`; the release gate is `startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')`).

# 12. Definition of done

```text
frontend action → API → runtime → real operation → state update
→ visible result → error path → cancellation → tests → verification
```

A button is not a feature. An endpoint is not a feature. A compile is not a feature. A commit is not proof.

# 13. Immediate next tasks (priority order)

```text
1. Native generation PERF: the Phase 5 forward pass is portable scalar
   C++ (dequant-then-dot) — measured SLOWER than llama.cpp (see
   worklog.md Phase 5 performance table). SIMD/block-fused matvec,
   thread-parallel prefill and quantized-compute paths are the next
   lever. Correctness is pinned by the Python reference; optimize under
   it.
2. Native generation SCOPE: more architectures (the derive/validate/
   forward separation keeps arch-specific behaviour explicit), K-quants,
   chat-template interpretation (currently a plain role-labeled prompt),
   tool-call formatting/parsing on the native path.
3. Native engine packaging: build + ship shtn-engine-host in the
   portable layout (bin/) with an update path (updater pattern).
4. Vision pipeline verification with a real mmproj projector
5. Tool-calling reliability tuning with larger instruct models
6. Continuum rollover exercise under real long sessions (it is wired +
   unit-tested; it has not yet been observed in a real multi-hour thread)
7. Context Engine foundations (PLANNED work — see ARCHITECTURE.md
   Part II; Phase 3 shipped the bounded chunk/cache/metrics layer it
   will build on, NOT the semantic index itself)
8. Model tier discovery + capability-based routing (PLANNED — see
   ARCHITECTURE.md §II.2)
```

# 14. Architectural direction (PLANNED — read `ARCHITECTURE.md` Part II)

The validated direction for SHEYTAN's future AI runtime, in one paragraph:
small fast local models are the foundation (`many efficient agents +
orchestration + tools + external memory + verification`, never one
giant model); a tier ladder (Tier 0 smallest → Tier 4 optional
high-end multimodal) routes work by capability with model-agnostic,
hardware-adaptive rules; the Context Engine treats model context as
working memory backed by external project memory (structural index →
semantic index → hierarchical retrieval → budgeted context builder);
context budgeting enforces the smallest sufficient working set;
specialized agents (planner, coder, researcher, tester, debugger,
documentation, reviewer, verifier) communicate through structured
artifacts (`analysis.json`, `patch.diff`, `findings.md`,
`test-results.json`); document editing flows through section-aware
retrieval, structured patches and objective validation gates where the
model is never the authority on correctness.

Every clause above is **future architecture**. The current runtime is a
sequential single-agent loop with one model per session (plus the
CLI-only sequential multiagent pipeline). Full details, current-state
notes and the candidate model examples (verified 2026-09, labeled
non-integrated) are in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

# 15. Final rule

Prefer real behavior + verification + reliability over more panels, more settings, more visual features. The next agent must work from evidence, not assumptions.
