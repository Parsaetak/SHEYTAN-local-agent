// engine.h — the SHEYTAN Native Engine C ABI (v1.1.5Z Phase 4).
//
// This is the NARROW boundary the Go core sees. Only C types, only
// coarse operations — no C++ classes, templates or exceptions cross this
// line. The Go core does NOT link this ABI directly; it supervises the
// shtn-engine-host subprocess which wraps exactly these functions behind
// the length-prefixed JSON IPC protocol (see doc.go in
// internal/native/engine for the boundary rationale).
//
// Phase 1 surface (implemented, unchanged):
//   shtn_engine_create / shtn_engine_destroy   engine lifecycle
//   shtn_engine_health                          active health probe
//   shtn_engine_hardware_info                   detected hardware profile
//   shtn_engine_metrics                         measured metrics
//   shtn_abi_version                            ABI negotiation
//
// Phase 2 surface (implemented — native GGUF model loading):
//   shtn_engine_load_model                      validate + map + plan
//   shtn_engine_unload_model                    release everything
//   shtn_engine_model_info                      real metadata snapshot
//   shtn_engine_memory_plan                     load-time budget
//
// Phase 4 surface (implemented — foundation primitives; NO inference):
//   shtn_engine_tokenizer_init                  materialize GGUF tokenizer
//   shtn_engine_tokenizer_info                  vocab snapshot
//   shtn_engine_tokenizer_encode                UTF-8 → token ids
//   shtn_engine_tokenizer_decode                token ids → UTF-8
//   shtn_engine_kv_cache_info                   measured KV cache snapshot
//   shtn_engine_scheduler_info                  measured scheduler snapshot
//
// NOT implemented (later phases — the honest answer is an error code):
//   inference / token generation / GPU kernels / forward pass.
//
// The Phase 4 surface is real but does NOT produce generated text:
// the tokenizer, KV cache, scheduler and sampler are implemented and
// measured, but the transformer forward pass is not. Generation requests
// still return SHTN_ERR_UNSUPPORTED and the llama.cpp fallback remains
// the production generation backend.
//
// Conventions:
//   - every call returns int32_t: 0 = success, negative = error code;
//   - structs are filled only with values this build can actually
//     detect, measure, read or derive;
//   - all calls are safe under concurrency per engine instance (internal
//     mutex); NULL arguments are rejected, never dereferenced.
